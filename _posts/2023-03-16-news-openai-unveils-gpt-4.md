[OpenAI](https://openai.com/) has achieved a significant milestone with the creation of GPT-4, the latest development in their ongoing efforts to scale up deep learning. GPT-4 is a large multimodal model capable of accepting both image and text inputs, and generating text outputs. 

While it may not yet surpass human capabilities in every real-world scenario, it does demonstrate human-level performance on a wide range of professional and academic benchmarks. For instance, GPT-4 can pass a simulated bar exam with a score ranking among the top 10% of test-takers, a notable improvement over its predecessor, GPT-3.5, which scored around the bottom 10%.

Over the course of six months, OpenAI has worked diligently to iteratively align GPT-4 using insights from their adversarial testing program, as well as from ChatGPT. This has resulted in their best-ever outcomes in terms of factuality, steerability, and adherence to imposed guardrails, although there is still room for improvement.

In the past two years, OpenAI has completely re-engineered their deep learning stack. They have also collaborated closely with Azure to design a supercomputer specifically tailored to their workload. About a year ago, GPT-3.5 was trained as an initial "test run" of the system. 

This exercise allowed them to identify and address bugs while refining their theoretical foundations. Consequently, the GPT-4 training run proved to be remarkably stable, marking the first instance where OpenAI could accurately predict a large model's training performance in advance. As the organization continues to prioritize reliable scaling, they aspire to refine their methodology, enabling them to predict and prepare for future capabilities well in advanceâ€”a critical aspect for ensuring safety.

OpenAI is launching GPT-4's text input capabilities through ChatGPT and the API (with a waitlist). To make the image input functionality more widely accessible, they are initially collaborating with a single partner. Furthermore, OpenAI is open-sourcing their framework for automated evaluation of AI model performance, called OpenAI Evals. This will enable anyone to report shortcomings in their models, thereby guiding further enhancements.

GPT-4 serves as a testament to the impressive advancements made by OpenAI in the realm of deep learning. By refining and expanding upon earlier models like GPT-3.5, the organization has successfully developed a more capable and reliable multimodal model that can handle both text and image inputs. The ongoing pursuit of improvements in factuality, steerability, and adherence to guardrails demonstrates OpenAI's commitment to creating AI technologies that are both powerful and safe for use.

Collaboration has been a crucial component of OpenAI's success, as evidenced by their close partnership with Azure in the development of a purpose-built supercomputer. Moreover, their open-source approach to sharing evaluation frameworks, such as OpenAI Evals, underscores their dedication to involving the wider AI community in the ongoing quest for improvement.

As OpenAI continues to forge ahead in the development of ever more advanced AI models like GPT-4, it is clear that they are making significant strides toward achieving their goal of reliable scaling. By maintaining a strong focus on safety and fostering collaboration with partners and the broader AI community, OpenAI is well-positioned to make even greater leaps in the future of deep learning technology.
