Lately, everyone in the tech world has been going crazy over AI and chatbots. Big companies like Microsoft and Google are working super hard to make their AI tools even better. But there's one famous name that's been super quiet about it all: [Apple](https://apple.com). Sure, the Silicon Valley Bank collapse has been in the news a lot, but AI is still a hot topic.

Just last month, Apple had a secret meeting all about AI and huge language models. The New York Times said that tons of teams, even the ones working on Siri, are trying out new ways to make language with AI. Plus, 9to5Mac spilled the beans about Apple making something called "Siri Natural Language Generation" for tvOS 16.4.

For a long time, Siri hasn't been great at understanding what people are saying (trust me, I've had trouble too). Siri and other helpers like Alexa and Google Assistant have had a tough time getting different accents and pronunciations right, even if everyone's speaking the same language. But now, with cool stuff like ChatGPT and text-based search, it's way easier to talk to AI. The only problem is, right now, you have to turn on a special setting to chat with Siri.

John Burke, who used to work at Apple on Siri, told [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) that Siri hasn't gotten much better because of some messy code. That means it's super hard to add even simple updates. He also said that Siri has a ginormous pile of words, so when they want to add new stuff, they have to rebuild the whole thing, which can take up to six weeks. Yikes!

The New York Times didn't say if Apple is making its own language models or if they're going to use one that's already out there. But just like Google and Microsoft, Apple probably doesn't want to be stuck with just a Siri chatbot. Apple has always been super supportive of artists and creative people, so they'd probably want to use language models to help those folks too.

Apple has actually been using AI for a while now, even if you don't notice it right away. They've got better suggestions on the keyboard, smarter photo processing, unlocking with Face ID while wearing a mask, and even separating things from their background in pictures. They also have handwashing and crash detection on the Apple Watch, and they recently added a karaoke feature to Apple Music. These things might not be as in-your-face as chatbots, but they show that Apple knows what they're doing with AI.

In January, Apple started a program where they help authors turn their books into audiobooks using AI-powered voices. This means that Apple is already thinking about how to use AI to make new stuff. I wouldn't be shocked if we hear more about what Apple is doing with AI at the Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) in a few months.

So, with everyone in the tech world talking non-stop about AI and chatbots, we're all wondering what Apple is going to do to keep up with everyone else. Will Siri make a big comeback? We'll have to wait and see, but one thing's for sure: Apple is just getting started with [AI](https://techwizco.com/text-to-speech-mp3/).
