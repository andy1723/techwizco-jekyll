Achieving and maintaining a good level of fitness is essential for leading a healthy life. However, many people struggle to stay motivated and on track with their fitness goals due to various reasons. You may feel like it's too difficult or time-consuming, or you may not know where to start.

Perhaps you've tried different workout routines but have not seen the results you were expecting. Another challenge is staying motivated over time.

So what's the solution? Enter the world of AI fitness apps - innovative solutions that aim at solving these challenges using [artificial intelligence (AI) technology](https://techwizco.com/comprehensive-guide-to-artificial-intelligence/). Today, we're featuring a few such apps.
