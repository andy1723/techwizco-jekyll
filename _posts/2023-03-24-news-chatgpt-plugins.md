## Introducing ChatGPT Plugins

Have you heard? ChatGPT now has plugin support! These nifty tools are designed to help ChatGPT get up-to-date info, do computations, and even work with third-party services. OpenAI is rolling them out gradually to study their real-world use, impact, and safety. Users have been craving plugins since the dawn of ChatGPT, and now they're finally here!


## So Many Possibilities

Plugins unlock a vast range of potential use cases, and OpenAI is excited to build a community around them. Some cool cats like Expedia, Shopify, and Wolfram have already created their first plugins. OpenAI is also hosting two of their own: a web browser and code interpreter.

With plugins, users can expect ChatGPT to handle more complex tasks, like browsing product catalogs, booking flights, or ordering food. The sky's the limit! OpenAI believes that open standards will emerge to unify the ways AI-facing interfaces are exposed, and they're actively seeking feedback from developers interested in collaborating.


## Gradual Rollout for Users and Developers

Today, OpenAI is extending alpha access to users and developers from their waitlist. While they'll start small, they plan to roll out larger-scale access over time. Expect plugins to help overcome language model limitations, like "hallucinations" and outdated info.

The gradual rollout begins with ChatGPT Plus subscribers, who will be the first to access existing plugins from early collaborators. Developers will also be able to start creating their own plugins. OpenAI plans to iterate on the plugin protocol as they learn from deployment and continue to improve safety systems. Eventually, they'll enable developers using OpenAI models to integrate plugins into their own applications beyond ChatGPT.


## Risks and Rewards

Plugins offer loads of benefits, but they also come with risks. OpenAI is working hard to implement safeguards against potential harmful actions or misuse of information. They've done red-teaming exercises to uncover risks and are gradually deploying access to plugins.

By integrating explicit access to external data, language models can strengthen their responses with evidence-based references. This enhances the model's utility and allows users to assess the trustworthiness of the output. However, there is a risk that plugins could increase safety challenges by taking harmful or unintended actions, or by enabling bad actors to defraud, mislead, or abuse others. OpenAI has taken these factors into account since day one, implementing several safeguards to minimize risks.


## Learnings from Red-Teaming

Red-teaming exercises have revealed several concerning scenarios, such as sophisticated prompt injection, sending fraudulent and spam emails, bypassing safety restrictions, or misusing information sent to the plugin. OpenAI is using these findings to inform safety-by-design mitigations, restricting risky plugin behaviors and improving transparency around how and when plugins are operating.

Researchers interested in studying safety risks or mitigations in this area are encouraged to use OpenAI's Researcher Access Program. Developers and researchers can also submit plugin-related safety and capability evaluations as part of the recently open-sourced Evals framework.


## Societal Implications

Plugins will likely have wide-ranging societal implications. OpenAI recently released a working paper that found language models with access to tools will likely have much greater economic impacts than those without. More generally, they expect the current wave of AI technologies to have a significant effect on job transformation, displacement, and creation. OpenAI is eager to collaborate with external researchers and customers to study these impacts.


## Experimental Models: Browsing and Coding

[OpenAI has created a web browsing plugin](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins) that gives ChatGPT access to a text-based web browser, prioritizing both safety and being a good citizen of the web. This browser allows ChatGPT to search for specific information in real-time, providing up-to-date and accurate answers to user queries. It respects website terms of service, robots.txt rules, and avoids undue burden on web infrastructure. OpenAI continues to explore ways to improve the browsing experience while maintaining safety and ethical standards.

In addition, OpenAI has developed a code interpreter plugin that enables ChatGPT to interact with programming languages, execute code snippets, and help users with debugging or problem-solving. This powerful tool can assist developers in writing code, learning new languages, or tackling challenging programming tasks.


## A Thriving Ecosystem

OpenAI envisions a thriving ecosystem of AI services and plugins, with third-party developers and organizations contributing to a rich library of tools. This will not only make ChatGPT more useful but also allow for the development of niche applications catering to specific industries or user groups.

To support this ecosystem, OpenAI will provide resources and guidelines for plugin development, making it easy for developers to create, share, and monetize their plugins. OpenAI will also maintain a plugin marketplace where users can discover, rate, and review various plugins to help the best tools rise to the top.


## Future of ChatGPT Plugins

As the ChatGPT plugin ecosystem grows and evolves, OpenAI will continue to focus on improving safety, utility, and accessibility. They'll actively seek feedback from users, developers, and researchers to refine their systems and encourage the responsible development and use of AI technologies.

The future of ChatGPT plugins looks bright, as they'll enable a wide range of applications and help the AI community to overcome existing limitations. OpenAI is committed to advancing AI in a way that is safe and beneficial for all, and the introduction of ChatGPT plugins is a significant step in that direction.

So, get ready to plug in and power up your ChatGPT experience with these amazing new tools! The world of [AI ](https://techwizco.com/10-ways-artificial-intelligence-is-changing-the-world/)has never been more exciting, and OpenAI is paving the way for even more incredible innovations to come.
