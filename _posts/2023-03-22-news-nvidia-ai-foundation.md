Exciting news everyone! Jensen just announced the arrival of [NVIDIA AI Foundations](https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/keynote) - the new game changer in the world of enterprise AI! This is definitely something worth discussing and getting excited about!

The world of AI is rapidly evolving and changing the way we work and interact with technology. The potential of AI to transform the enterprise landscape is huge, and NVIDIA AI Foundations is at the forefront of this transformation.

So, what exactly is NVIDIA AI Foundations, and what makes it so exciting? Let's dive deeper and explore the features and benefits of this groundbreaking platform.


### Foundation Model as a Service

One of the most exciting features of NVIDIA AI Foundations is the Foundation Model as a Service. This new service allows you to get your very own AI model customized specifically for your proprietary data.

This is a game changer because it means that you can get the exact solution that you need for your specific business problem. This is particularly important because off-the-shelf AI models may not be sufficient to meet the unique requirements of your business.

With the Foundation Model as a Service, NVIDIA is making it possible for businesses to leverage the power of AI in a way that is tailored to their specific needs.


### Multimodal Platform

Another exciting feature of NVIDIA AI Foundations is the multimodal platform. This platform allows you to use not just text, but also images, videos, and even 3D data to build custom multimodal LLM and generative models that fit your specific use case.

This is particularly important because many businesses have complex problems that cannot be solved with a single mode of data. By using a multimodal approach, businesses can build more robust and accurate AI models that can solve a wider range of problems.

The multimodal platform also means that businesses can leverage the power of AI in new and innovative ways. For example, a company that sells furniture could use AI to help customers visualize how a piece of furniture would look in their home using 3D data.


### Exciting Partnerships

NVIDIA AI Foundations has already partnered with big names in the industry such as Getty Images, Shutterstock, and Adobe. This means that businesses can get access to the high-quality data sets they need to build AI models that are accurate and useful.

Partnerships like these are important because they help to overcome one of the biggest challenges in building effective AI models - access to high-quality data. By partnering with companies that have access to large amounts of data, NVIDIA AI Foundations is making it easier for businesses to build accurate and effective AI models.


### Support for Biology

NVIDIA AI Foundations even supports biology as a unique type of LLM, making it the first large-scale AlphaFold API/finetuning service! This is great news for drug discovery and research pipelines.

The ability to use AI to solve complex biological problems has the potential to revolutionize the healthcare industry. By leveraging the power of [AI](https://techwizco.com/10-ways-artificial-intelligence-is-changing-the-world/), researchers can develop new treatments and drugs faster and more effectively than ever before.

This is an important area of focus for NVIDIA AI Foundations because it has the potential to make a real difference in people's lives. The ability to accelerate the development of new drugs and treatments could mean the difference between life and death for some patients.


### Enterprise-First AI Provider

With all of these features and benefits, it's no surprise that 2023 is being called an inflection point for NVIDIA. The company is taking a giant leap forward from being just a hardware provider to becoming an enterprise-first AI provider.

This is an important shift for NVIDIA because it means that the company is taking a more holistic approach to AI. By focusing on the needs of enterprise customers, NVIDIA is better able to provide solutions that are tailored to the unique requirements of businesses.

This shift is also important because it reflects the growing importance of AI in the enterprise landscape. As more and more businesses look to leverage the power of AI to gain a competitive advantage, it's important for companies like NVIDIA to provide solutions that can meet their needs.

The future of AI is exciting, and NVIDIA AI Foundations is at the forefront of this exciting new era. NVIDIA AI Foundations is well positioned to be a major player in the enterprise AI landscape.
