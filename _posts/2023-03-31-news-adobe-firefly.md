Hey there, creative minds! Adobe's stepping into the generative AI game with Firefly, a new family of AI models aimed at enhancing their suite of apps and services for generating media content. Adobe VP of generative AI, Alexandru Costin, says Firefly combines their "gentech" models with years of expertise in imaging, typography, and illustration, bringing a new level of value to Creative Cloud, Experience Cloud, and Document Cloud workflows.

Currently in beta, Firefly's first model focuses on generating images and text effects from descriptions, thanks to the training it received from hundreds of millions of photos. Soon, it'll be integrated across Adobe apps like Express, Photoshop, Illustrator, and Adobe Experience Manager, allowing users to generate content with just a text prompt. For now, you can visit a dedicated website to use it. Beyond basic text-to-image generation, Adobe's first Firefly model can "transfer" different styles to existing images à la Prisma. Drawing on user-supplied descriptions, it can also apply styles or textures to lettering and fonts.

While Firefly shares similarities with other text-to-image AI models like OpenAI's DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion, Adobe claims it will sidestep the ethical and logistical issues that have plagued its rivals. These issues include copyright and fair use dilemmas, as well as concerns about objectionable content, biased depictions of gender, ethnicity, and sexuality, and nonconsensual deepfakes.

To avoid copyright and fair use dilemmas, Adobe is training Firefly models exclusively on content from Adobe Stock, the company's royalty-free media library, along with openly licensed or public domain content where the copyright has expired. In the future, users can even train and fine-tune Firefly models using their own content, steering outputs toward specific styles and design languages.

Adobe is also exploring compensation models for Stock contributors to monetize their talents and benefit from Firefly-generated revenue. It might look something like Shutterstock's recently-launched Contributors Fund, which reimburses creators whose work is used to train AI art models. Contributors can opt out of training by attaching a "do not train" credentials tag to their work. Adobe is pushing for industry adoption of this tag to ensure models aren't trained on out-of-bounds content.

Addressing concerns about [AI-generated content](https://techwizco.com/ai-art-generator/), Costin says Firefly models were trained using "carefully curated" and "inclusive" image datasets, with a combination of automated and human moderation and filters to detect and block toxic content. Adobe will regularly update Firefly to improve performance and mitigate harm and bias in its output, allowing users to provide feedback and suggestions.

The introduction of Firefly also raises questions about the impact of generative AI on creators' ability to benefit from their skills, maintain credit and control over their work, and the viability of generated content in commercial settings. Artists have voiced their discontent with AI-generated art, fearing that it doesn't properly credit them or that they might be associated with a model that generates objectionable content.

On the second point, Costin says that Adobe employs a range of techniques to detect and block toxic content, including automated and human moderation and filters. History has shown that these sorts of measures can be bypassed, but Costin suggests that it'll be a carefully guided — if imperfect — learning process. "We've made a big investment in models to help prevent bias and harm in the content Firefly generates. 

Those models analyze both the prompts and the content to ensure Firefly generates a wide variety of images that represent a balance of cultures and ethnicities, as well as ensuring Firefly does not generate harmful images," Costin said. "We will regularly update Firefly to improve its performance and mitigate harm and bias in its output. We also provide feedback mechanisms for our users to report potentially biased outputs or provide suggestions into our testing and development processes."

[Adobe's Firefly](https://www.adobe.com/sensei/generative-ai/firefly.html) is but one of several initiatives aimed at giving artists more control over their work's role in generative model training. For instance, DeviantArt has launched a new protection using an HTML tag to prevent web crawlers from downloading images for training sets. AI startup Spawning, in partnership with platforms like ArtStation and Shutterstock, offers a tool allowing artists to remove their images from datasets used to train AI models.

With around 900 members in the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI), Adobe's proposals stand a good chance of gaining traction. However, artists may still find themselves needing multiple opt-out tools to protect their artwork from being trained on.

Adobe customers must navigate another challenge: determining the rights to Firefly-generated artwork. U.S. federal guidance on the copyright status of AI art remains unclear. Costin acknowledges that the law is currently unsettled, but Adobe believes that using its tools to add "creative input" to a generated image should be enough for creators to obtain copyright.

"As always, creators will need to seek out the copyrights themselves and do what is necessary or required to obtain that ownership," Costin says, cautiously optimistic. Despite potential setbacks on the copyright or licensing front, Adobe plans to expand Firefly, introducing models that generate illustrations, graphic designs, 3D models, and more.

Adobe's Firefly is ambitious and, although late to the party, has the advantage of a massive built-in customer base. Creative Cloud boasts 600 million monthly active users, while Experience Cloud has 12,000 customers, including 87% of the Fortune 100. With Acumen Research and Consulting estimating the generative AI market to be worth over $110 billion by 2030, Adobe's Firefly has the potential to generate significant revenue.

However, only time will tell if Adobe can overcome the numerous hurdles (and competitors) standing in its way, not to mention the costly compute necessary to develop and run new Firefly models. Legal and ethical roadblocks aside, Adobe must make up for lost time and mindshare in a highly competitive field.

Costin remains optimistic, stating that the company is up for the challenge. "Future Firefly models will leverage a variety of assets, tech, and training data from Adobe and others," he added. "We are designing generative AI to support creators in benefiting from their skills and creativity. By building Firefly directly into our customers' workflows, we can help creative professionals work more efficiently and spend their time on the higher-value work that they love."
