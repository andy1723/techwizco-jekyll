## What Convesio next generation WordPress hosting is about?

Convesio, being a cloud-based hosting platform, offers WordPress users the most up-to-date web technology. In contrast to typical solutions, Convesio's multi-tenant environment allows each website on their system to be backed up by redundant data storage clusters, as well as having offshore backup options for those who desire it! You can also improve the performance of your sites by substantially scaling PHP run time and, if necessary, using auto-healing architecture solutions.

WordPress hosting at its finest Convesio is a platform that combines open source software and proprietary code to solve a single problem: operating WordPress in large-scale environments. The solution includes built-in features such as Cloudflare Enterprise, which improves performance while delivering an extra layer of security to your website before requests even reach the servers!

Convesio is a hybrid cloud solution that handles your WordPress demands by overcoming the problems associated with hosting it on scalable environments. With high availability and elastic scalability in mind, it has been deployed across Google Cloud, AWS, and Steadfast platforms.

## What is managed WordPress hosting?

Managed WordPress hosting is a dedicated environment intended for speed, high availability, scalability, and security when just running WordPress.

Managed WordPress hosting simply implies that you are not responsible for any underlying infrastructure, such as web server updates, backups, security checks, and so on. It is typically faster, more secure, and contains extra services such as automatic backups.

Because Convesio managed WordPress hosting includes load balancers, a cache layer, built-in edge caching, HTTP/2, and CDN technologies, your website will load significantly faster than on standard shared hosting.

Convesio is a proprietary design that allows your site (and hence all of its contents) to scale automatically if you need to handle high volumes of traffic. The system runs in several containers on multiple servers to handle any demand - even an unexpected surge!

## Benefits Of Using Best WordPress Hosting Convesio

- **High Avalability** Convesio's powerful load-balancer containers ensure that your site is always available. As a result, you can be confident that yours will always be up and running, even during peak hours when other websites may encounter downtime!

- **Horizontal Autoscaling** - When the number of visitors to your website increases, Convesio's auto-scaling mechanism automatically expands the server farm with more virtual servers. This saves you money because you won't need a system administrator for this work, and it also improves performance because resources are controlled dynamically instead!

- **WordPress speed optimization** - Let's face it, your website needs to be fast, dependable, and simple for customers/clients (and potential ones!) to navigate; but most importantly, they want the site load times on their devices or browsers to be low enough so things feel snappy with no lag at all! Convesio WordPress hosting analyzes how much capacity YOU require with our free performance optimization analysis...we'll even show you where areas could benefit from some modifications so you don't have to worry about having additional hardware later on.

- **MySQL DB Cluster** - Convesio WordPress hosting includes a strong MySQL server cluster that eliminates a single point of failure. This means you may expect rapid and efficient responses when processing information requests from viewers or customers!

- **Page Caching** Convesio's cache is entirely custom-built and designed from the ground up for WordPress. Because the platform is entirely made up of novel features, no WordPress plugins are necessary! With con successive layers such as time to live settings or exception rules, you can control page level storage on your website to ensure that all data remains fresh even if someone returns later without having previously visited it - this way, their visit will be faster due to less reloading/refreshing required at each step through pages while they browse around.

- **Automated backups** - With a single click, you can configure advanced backup and retention settings, including how frequently backups should be performed and how long each kind should be stored. Backup periods can range from 24 hours to 180 days - that's a lot more control than most people realize! You can also utilize your backup to set up a staging WordPress site.

- **Application Monitoring** - Development teams can utilize Convesio to collect application performance monitoring (APM) log data to ensure the seamless delivery of their online apps. Developers can check an app's availability, problems it may have introduced into your site, or other things that may have a negative impact on end-user experience; you will be notified before any changes go live.

- **WordPress Self Recovery** - If you want an easy solution to shield yourself from the risks of restoring a web hosting database, go no further than Convesio's self-restoration data option. It keeps backups of all your crucial data and restores them automatically if something goes wrong.

- **Complex Migrations** - Because some of the more complex WordPress installations cannot be converted with a simple plugin, Convesio provides manual migration to assure proper functioning, minimal downtime, and data integrity.

- **Free SSL for all domains** - With the auto-renew option, you may map as many subdomains as you need to your main domain and easily install SSL certificates for each one. Everything is free.

## What is a Docker Platform and why does it matter

This is why it's so crucial to have a few different servers for your websites. If one goes down or becomes overburdened, you may still give outstanding service by switching over all the sites on that particular machine rather than losing patience with waiting periods while trying other solutions such as relocating their domain name!

A typical but easily avoidable issue is server failure, which can occur when every single website created under one administrative account is hosted at the same physical location, resulting in hundreds, if not thousands, of calls seeking immediate response.

Convesio has discovered a solution to the problem of site hosting by utilizing Docker containers. With no downtime, this innovative technology will give you more room on your server, faster speeds, and better security than ever before.

- Docker is a software platform that allows you to package and run your applications in containers on the same operating system as their hosts. The primary distinction between this strategy and standard virtual machines is found in two factors: The overhead associated with managing different instances is frequently not worth it; isolation—because everything operates inside one cohesive unit, there are no security issues associated with merely running several workloads concurrently.

- You may have an up-to-date website in seconds with container services. This is accomplished by software virtualization, which enables the service to run numerous apps concurrently on a single server without slowing down or crashing any of them.

- Convesio's hosting solution is more useful than other virtual server providers because of its versatility. You can host an unlimited number of websites on the autoscaling Docker environment with a single account.

- Container technology transforms websites by eliminating the danger of website failure and making traffic balancing easier. Docker containers, because they are built on several servers, are an ideal approach to ensure that your website and data are safe in the event of a disaster.

- Convesio provides numerous containers for each customer that may be automatically scaled up or down in response to traffic levels. These quick-scaling, simple management capabilities assist you in meeting your high availability and scalability requirements!

### Shared Hosting

Shared hosting services are ideal for small or medium-sized websites because they offer the same resources as other WordPress accommodation sites. The primary distinction is that shared web hosting allow numerous sites to share a single server, as well as storage and bandwidth.

Shared hosting might be an excellent method to reduce your web hosting costs, but it comes at the expense of performance. Depending on how many websites they host on the same server, services may overwhelm and slow down for other customers as well.

### VPS Hosting

VPS stands for Virtual Private Server, and it means that your website is hosted on a separate virtual server that only you have access to.

Currently, Convesio clusters are implemented in North America, Europe, and Australia.

**6. How is Convesio container usage different from other hosting providers?**

Here is an explanation [from Convesio](https://convesio.com/faq/): 

>Other popular providers do take advantage of containers, but in a very different way than Convesio. Effectively they are using containers as the next generation VPS. All the components of your site run inside a single scalable container. This creates an environment similar to a traditional VPS with all the normal Single Points of Failure associated with WordPress. We have a container based architecture that is scalable at several different layers. For instance, your WordPress runtime, which is just your PHP Instance, can scale separately from your DB Instance and our Load Balancers. 

>When your site comes under heavy load, these other container based systems can scale up your resources increasing RAM, CPU, etc to handle the load. Convesio’s architecture uses a scale out process to replicate your site running in multiple containers, all attached to a multi-node Percona XtraDB Cluster. The advantage of our system is we have the ability to run your site on multiple servers simultaneously, which greatly increases redundancy and scaling capacity.

**7. Does Convesio support WordPress Multisite?**

Currently, Convesio does not support this feature.

**8. Can A WordPress site run on multiple containers?**

A website can be run in one single PHP runtime container or multiple containers. Each has its own set number of workers and vcores, so if your site is processor intensive with a lot of visitors you should run it from the start on multiple containers.

## Is Convesio the greatest WordPress hosting company?
