Even the most advanced AI and machine learning technologies are still far from being able to fully understand the nuances of creative language. Also, AI can't model human emotions and empathy yet, which are very important in many creative fields.

Political and strategizing jobs will also likely remain in human hands in the future. AI still has a long way to go before it can think critically and come up with new ways to solve strategic problems. One supercharged [language model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00628) might be able to make a lot of text, but it can't make decisions that require critical thinking and an understanding of the context.

The same is true for other tasks such as health care or industrial automation. AI can be used to automate some tasks, but there will always be a need for human hands in many industries.

The same is true for new industries that are emerging. Even though there have been recent advances in technology, many of these industries will still need people to do some tasks. For example, paper paints mixed with similar technology may be used to create a new industry, but the technology will still require human hands to operate.

Since the industrial revolution in the early 1900s, people have been worried about how new technologies affect work. However, the introduction of new technologies has often led to economic growth and the creation of new industries, leading to more tech savvy jobs. Although there may be some job losses due to automation and emerging technologies, humans will still be needed in many industries in the future.
