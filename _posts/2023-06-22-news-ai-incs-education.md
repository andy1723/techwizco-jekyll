In an innovative move, Harvard's renowned coding course, [Computer Science 50: Introduction to Computer Science](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x?utm_source=google&utm_campaign=19322989673&utm_medium=cpc&utm_term=learn%20cs50&hsa_acc=7245054034&hsa_cam=19322989673&hsa_grp=149370123298&hsa_ad=655859286701&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-2008491272786&hsa_kw=learn%20cs50&hsa_mt=e&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=Cj0KCQjw4s-kBhDqARIsAN-ipH05QiC9bO4nEyEFMONCDakDaYi4ANGCxyxAvLi4oGXxq5ViEKIv3ssaAiGPEALw_wcB), will be integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into its teaching methodology. This development was shared by Professor David J. Malan '99 during a lecture on binary.

Starting from the upcoming fall semester, students will have the opportunity to utilize AI to debug their code, receive feedback on their program designs, understand unfamiliar code or error messages, and get answers to individual queries. This integration of AI into the course is seen as a natural progression of the course's tradition of incorporating software, according to Professor Malan.

The recent surge in AI usage, with large language models like ChatGPT becoming freely accessible, has had significant impacts on various sectors, including academia. Despite not having a formal AI policy at the end of the fall 2022 semester, Harvard has been increasing its communication about AI usage in classes.

The CS50 team is currently experimenting with GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 models. The ultimate goal is to approximate a 1:1 teacher-student ratio for every student in CS50 through AI. This would be achieved by providing software-based tools that can support students' learning around the clock, tailored to their individual pace and style.

A "CS50 bot" is being developed to answer frequently asked questions on Ed Discussion, a popular discussion board software for STEM classes. AI-generated responses can be reviewed by human course staff. This feature is currently being beta-tested in the summer school version of CS50.

While AI programs like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot are currently very helpful, the AI technology in CS50 will guide students towards finding answers rather than providing them directly. The AI will assist students in identifying bugs in their code and explaining complex error messages in simpler terms, offering potential solutions.

Despite the integration of AI, the difficulty level of the course will not increase. On the topic of potential cheating with AI and other forms of academic dishonesty, Professor Malan acknowledged that students have always had access to information in potentially unauthorized ways. However, he believes that the integration of AI into the course will necessitate a greater emphasis on ethics.

CS50, one of the most popular courses on edX, will also have AI incorporated into its online version. This will help provide support tailored to students' specific questions, a challenge that has been difficult to overcome at scale via edX and OpenCourseWare.

Despite complaints of overworked and underpaid course staff, Professor Malan hopes that the integration of AI will reduce the time spent by course staff on grading. He believes that AI can help assess the design of students' code, which has remained a human-intensive task, thereby freeing up teaching fellows' time for more meaningful, interpersonal interactions with their students.

While the initial versions of the new AI programs may occasionally underperform or err, students are encouraged to think critically when receiving information, whether from humans or software. Feedback from students and teachers will be crucial in improving these tools.
