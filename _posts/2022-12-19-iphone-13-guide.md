This thorough iPhone user guide gives you complete information on what iPhone 13 to choose, how to start using it quickly, and the necessary tips and techniques to be secure and comfortable with the smartphone.

The good news is you don't have to read through 1063 pages of the official iPhone User Guide - here it is…

## iPhone 13 initial setup

It is simple to get started with your new iPhone. Make sure it's completely charged, then press the power button and follow the on-screen instructions step by step. However, in order to get the most out of your phone, some additional setup procedures must be completed.

Whether you are making a move from your previous android phone or upgrading your iPhone follow all Apple's setup procedures without skipping forward. This ensures that your new iPhone is configured in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications.

Your brand new iPhone is ready to use as soon as you take it out of the box! After a warm "Hello" all that's left are some basic actions and careful following the simple instructions. If everything is done correctly (or if no errors occur), your new iPhone will have its own personalized settings within minutes.

The good news is that you may set up a Face ID or Touch ID to ensure your safety when it comes to security. Pairing your Apple Watch will allow them to stay connected with all of its functions, including Daily Workouts and Activity Rings!

It's critical that you enable Face ID, which is the technique for unlocking your new iPhone using a facial scan. You should also educate Siri to recognize your voice so that you may utilize voice commands to perform numerous iPhone tasks. The term "electronic commerce" refers to the sale of goods and services over the internet.

Apple's setup screens now provide instructions for transferring from an Android phone or an older iPhone. The best way to upgrade from your older iPhone is using Apple's Quick Start function. It is uncomplicated to use the option to set up your new phone. Contacts, settings, and apps can be remotely transferred from one iPhone to another.

After you've configured your iPhone, it's time to experiment and become acquainted with all of its functions. This iPhone user guide will also assist you in configuring some of the most regularly used functions on your new iPhone, such as emergency features, email, contacts, and calendars, as well as learning about the iPhone camera, Apple Pay, Hey Siri, and other capabilities.

Many other apps will be covered in separate user manuals, including video chat app, health app, camera app, and countless Apple iPhone new features.

## iPhone emergency contact set up

When you're in trouble, you can use the iPhone 13's Emergency SOS feature. Press the Wake button and one of the phone's power buttons at the same time, then use this slider to turn off your phone or dial 911 for medical assistance!

It's always a good idea to be ready for emergencies. Apple iPhones may also send a text message with your GPS location and name, allowing you to be identified in an emergency case in an instant! To do so, open your iPhone contacts app, tap the name of the person you want to add to your emergency contacts, and then tap the Add to Emergency Contacts button.

The Apple iOS 15 Emergency SOS slider allows you to swiftly notify authorities of an accident. In addition, if you are unconscious during an accident, paramedics will be able to access your medical information via the Medical ID slider.

## iPhone Quick Start data transfer

If this is not your first iPhone, you will need to transfer your data to the new one. Your previous Apple smartphone must first be backed up. It is possible to accomplish this with any Mac, PC, or iCloud backup solution. If you'd like to back up to iCloud you can do so through the Settings app settings of your device.

Using an Apple Mac to backup Connect your iPhone to a Mac port and backup your phone using Finder or iTunes. You can also use iTunes on a Windows machine for backup. Tomsguide.com has a wonderful step-by-step iPhone backup guide.

When you've got your old iPhone backup in place, it's time to get started with data transfer, which is one of iOS 15's new capabilities. Check that your previous device is running iOS 11 or later. If necessary, upgrade. Have your old apple smartphone and your new iPhone close to one other. To begin, turn on your iPhone and slide up from the Hello prompt.

Despite the fact that new iPhones have excellent battery life, it is a good idea to connect both iPhones to a power outlet to avoid running out of power in the middle of a transfer procedure.

1. First, choose your language and country. Bring your first iPhone close to your new iPhone 13 or iPhone 13 Pro Max when the Quick Start option appears. If you like, you can also use the Set Up Manually option.

2. On the screen, you will notice an option to utilize your Apple ID to set up your new iPhone. Check that the ID is correct and then press the Continue button. If there is no way to proceed, ensure sure Bluetooth is turned on.

3. Wait till you see an animation on your new iPhone. Hold your old iPhone over the new one, then center the animation in the viewfinder. 

4. When you see a “Finish” message on your new iPhone follow the onscreen steps.  

5. Enter your old phone's passcode on your new device. Then follow the instructions to set up Face ID or Touch ID on your new iPhone. 

6. When you see the Transfer Data from the screen, tap Continue to begin transferring your data from your old iPhone to the new one. 

## iPhone 13 Face ID

Look at your app icons, click on "Settings," and then select "Face ID & Passcode" to set up your iPhone 13, iPhone 13 mini, or iPhone 13 Pro Max, or any other latest iPhone with iOS 11 or newer.

Click "Set Up Face ID," then "Get Started," and then follow the on-screen directions.

## New iOS 15 features

### Focus Mode

Your new iPhone has iOS 15 preloaded; but, if you have an earlier Apple iPhone you may easily upgrade to iOS 15. The following Apple phones, as well as future brands, are compatible with iOS 15:

+ iPhone 13 Pro Max   
+ iPhone 13 Pro 
+ iPhone 13
+ iPhone 13 mini
+ iPhone 12 Pro Max
+ iPhone 12 Pro
+ iPhone 12
+ iPhone 12 mini
+ iPhone SE (2020)
+ iPhone 11 Pro Max
+ iPhone 11 Pro
+ iPhone 11
+ iPhone XR
+ iPhone XS Max
+ iPhone XS
+ iPhone X
+ iPhone 8 Plus
+ iPhone 8
+ iPhone 7 Plus
+ iPhone 7
+ iPhone 6s Plus
+ iPhone 6s
+ iPhone SE (1st generation)
+ iPod touch (7th generation)

A Focus mode is one of the new and very helpful features of iOS 15. This function allows you to be busy without being distracted by regular notifications and other disruptions that come with all built-in apps.

When Focus mode is active, you may choose which alerts or notifications from the built-in apps you want to receive. You can also make a selection on how to position your apps on your apple phone depending on what activities you are at it now.

To set up a Focus Mode:

1.Open up your control center by pulling down from the top right corner of your home screen.

2.Tap on the word “Focus” to set a focus mode. If you tap on the crescent moon icon you will activate Do Not Disturb mode.

3.Select the Focus mode you would like to activate.

4.Tap on three dots next to the focus to set up a specific time for this mode. You can also set this mode until you leave your current location.

You may also configure your iPhone to receive notifications in Focus from specified apps and persons. Your phone's Home screen can also be changed for a Focus. Here is one of the greatest user manuals by tomsguide.com that explains in depth how to set up Focus mode on your Apple iPhone.

### Home Screen Widgets

Widgets, which were initially brought to the iPhone home screen with iOS 14 and are still available in the iOS 15th edition of the operating system preinstalled on your device. A widget is a fragment from an app that displays information at a glance; this saves you from having to start them or sift through all accessible information when you simply want something quick! On my main screen, I have weather and stock market apps that indicate current circumstances.

![iphone widgets](/assets/images/iphone-widgets-01.svg)

Widgets are a simple and appealing way to display useful information on your home screen. What's the best part? They may be stacked together to form what Apple refers to as a Smart Stack, which includes built-in apps! One of my favorite examples is how they've designed it so you don't have to check the widget box every single day - instead, these dynamic pieces alter themselves based upon whatever crucial material might crop up that morning (like meetings).

Your iPhone 13 is much more helpful with the new widgets. Third-party app developers have been granted a year by Apple to create their own interactive mobile apps and add them as configurable shortcuts on top of built-in ones like Caller ID or Camera app!

### Safari Tab Bar Adjustment

When iOS 15 was released, many people weren't aware that Apple had moved the tab bar from its traditional position at the top right of the web page down below. This made Safari more convenient for one-handed use on larger iPhones because you can now easily reach with your thumb rather than having to move up and down between different screens like before! It is particularly useful on larger phones like iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro, and iPhone 13 Pro Max. 

![safari tab bar](/assets/images/iphone-safari-tab-bar-01.svg)

If you don't like this change, you can easily reverse it. Enter Safari, press "aA" on the left side of the tab bar, and then select Show Top Address Bar from the pop-up menu that displays after making a selection - no more annoying navigation buttons!

### Photographic styles

The new Photographic Styles feature in the iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro, and iPhone 13 Pro Max elevates images to new heights. You can now modify your photos before you take them, providing folks an opportunity for some truly unique images they might not have thought about trying otherwise! This function enables you see your picture's appearance before you use the shutter button.

![iphone photo style](/assets/images/iphone-photo-style-01.svg)   
Source techwizco.com

If you look at one of the apple user guides you’ll find explanations on how to choose a photographic style. And it is a pretty easy process. Your camera is set to the standard option by default and to choose the style open your camera and tap ⌃ , tap an image stack and swipe left to see the different styles. You can choose from: 

Rich Contrast: Darker shadows, richer colors, and stronger contrast create a dramatic look.

+ Vibrant: Wonderfully bright and vivid colors create a brilliant yet natural look.   
+ Warm: Golden undertones create a warmer look.
+ Cool: Blue undertones create a cooler look.

You can also customize the effects of the styles by adjusting their color and warmth. 

### Cinematic Mode

With the new Cinematic Mode and extra cameras on the iPhone 13 series pro models, you can now create Hollywood-style videos. When you enable this function, your footage has a depth of field and automatically focuses based on what's happening in the video - so if someone turns towards another person for a chat, they'll become clearer than before!

Cinematic Setting, among other photographic styles, is a new, dedicated mode in the camera app for the iPhone 13. It is accessible alongside Video and Portrait shots while recording video! The focus will now move to whatever you tap on - thus if your video topic isn't crisp enough, for example, simply pressing again will remedy that problem without requiring any extra video edits from you by using this useful apple tool.

### Notifications

Notifications in iOS 15 are significantly more orderly and properly classified. Notifications can now be grouped by service, app, or person, which was not possible prior to iOS 15. The new notification options in iOS 15 are more customizable than ever! You may now specify which applications send them notifications and when they wish to be notified.

Furthermore, with the ability to disable system-wide or individual Focus, you can regulate how much information distractions bring into your life—ideal if there's anything specific going on right now that requires attention but shouldn't take over everything else.

But who has time to look through hundreds of notifications every day if you're a busy person? Notification summaries are here to keep your information private! Instead of being bombarded with alerts throughout the day from low-priority sources like Facebook or emails about what's going on in politics right now (which may or may not be of interest to us), we can now choose how many messages make up each summary; when they appear at specific times throughout the day—and whether or not we want these updates delivered straight to our phones without any additional intervention required.

### Visual Look Up

iOS 15 for iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro, and iPhone 13 Pro Max brought new smart camera functions - Visual Look Up and Live Text.

Give your photographs a dose of much-needed context with Visual Look Up! Simply swipe up on an image in any program that displays digital photographs, such as the iBooks Store or Mail App. You'll get information about where it was taken and what's going down right now — even if they're plants...or animals. Don't worry, this also works when browsing messages and websites accessed via links within such apps.

Another very useful iOS 15 feature that works on iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro, and iPhone 13 Pro Max is Live Text. It is a life saver if you need to copy a large portion of text from a screenshot or a picture and have to type it all manually. 

Apart from being able to read a qr code, Live Text lets you copy any text from your pictures or even from your camera and paste this text into a text field of any app that permits this action.

The good news is Live text can recognize typed and handwritten text details and understands several foreign languages including Chinese, Spanish, and German. This option also works in the Safari browser and in any app that you can use to type in. In those apps, you can use a Scan Text option.

When you click on Scan Text the phone camera will be activated and you’ll be able to scan all text details right into your message. 

### Share play

It's difficult to detach from life in a society where we're continually on our phones. But with FaceTime video chat app updates in iOS 15 and new features such as SharePlay that let you listen and watch films or share your screen with others during sessions without having any form of disruption from other apps that are operating in the background as before.

During a FaceTime chat, Share Play allows you to view movies and TV shows with your pals while conversing and sharing your screen. This option is available on all iPhone 13 models, including the iPhone 13 mini.

The good news is that SharePlay works with TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Fitness+, as well as many popular apps such as NBA, TikTok, Twitch, Paramount+, and SHOWTIME. Users can utilize Share Play to watch Apple TV on the big screen while conversing with friends on their iPhone or iPad.

### iPhone 13 Pro Max camera

There are three cameras on the back of the iPhone 13 Pro and one on the front of the larger iPhone 13 Pro Max. There are three cameras on the back: a 12MP wide, a 12MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom, and a 12MP ultrawide. On the front is a 12MP wide camera. In comparison to earlier versions, there are several new design components, such as a reduced notch, etc.

To give high quality movies with moving focus effects, details, and tricks, both phone cameras have a night mode with a LIDAR scanner, Dolby vision HDR 4K, macro mode, and cinematic mode.

Here are the key camera specs:

+ Primary: 12 MP sensor, 1.9µm pixels, 26 mm equivalent f/1.5-aperture lens, sensor shift OIS   
+ Ultra-wide: 12MP sensor, 13mm equivalent f/1.8-aperture lens, PDAF, 2cm macro
+ Tele: 12 MP sensor, 77mm equivalent f/2.8-aperture lens, OIS 
+ 3D sensor
+ 4K at 24/25/30/60 fps, 1080p at 25/30/60 fps, HDR video recording with Dolby Vision
+ Cinematic mode for recording videos with shallow depth of field (1080p at 30 fps)

## FAQs

### Are the iPhone 13 phones water-resistant?

Yes, all four models are IP68-rated against water and dust. They can be submerged up to 6 meters for 30 minutes. 

### Is there a fingerprint sensor on iPhone 13?

Nope. The newest iPhones come with a single biometric security system - Face ID. 

### cases for the iPhone 12 series fit the iPhone 13 series?

### Do the iPhone 13 phones have chargers in the box?

No chargers are included with any of the iPhone 13 series, however, they all support wireless charging.

### Does the iPhone 13 have better battery life?

The new A15 Bionic chipset in the iPhone 13 models is combined with a larger battery than its predecessor, providing each model longer battery life. The longer battery life on this latest generation of phones means you'll be able to enjoy up to 1-1/2 hours more talk time or web browsing before needing another charge while using them intensively; if your usage matches one of these three examples, there should only be about an hour difference in how long they last compared to previous generations.
