<h2 id="industry-leaves-academia-in-the-dust">Industry Leaves Academia in the Dust</h2>

<p>Until 2014, academia was the leading source of significant machine learning models. However, since then, industry has taken the reins, with 32 significant industry-produced models in 2022 compared to just three from academia. This shift is largely due to the increasing need for large amounts of data, compute power, and financial resources, which industries possess in abundance compared to nonprofits and academia.</p>

<h2 id="benchmark-performance-nearing-saturation">Benchmark Performance Nearing Saturation</h2>

<p>While AI continues to achieve state-of-the-art results, improvements on many benchmarks are becoming marginal. The speed at which saturation is reached is also increasing. To address this, more comprehensive benchmarking suites like BIG-bench and HELM are being introduced.</p>

<h2 id="ais-environmental-impact-a-double-edged-sword">AI’s Environmental Impact: A Double-Edged Sword</h2>

<p>AI can both help and harm the environment. Research by Luccioni et al. (2022) reveals that BLOOM’s training run emitted 25 times more carbon than a single air traveler on a one-way trip from New York to San Francisco. However, reinforcement learning models like BCOOLER show potential in optimizing energy usage.</p>

<h2 id="ai-the-worlds-best-new-scientist">AI: The World’s Best New Scientist?</h2>

Adobe’s stepping into the generative AI game with Firefly, a new family of AI models aimed at enhancing their suite of apps and services for generating media content. Adobe VP of generative AI, Alexandru Costin, says Firefly combines their “gentech” models with years of expertise in imaging, typography, and illustration, bringing a new level of value to Creative Cloud, Experience Cloud, and Document Cloud workflows.</p>

<p>Currently in beta, Firefly’s first model focuses on generating images and text effects from descriptions, thanks to the training it received from hundreds of millions of photos. Soon, it’ll be integrated across Adobe apps like Express, Photoshop, Illustrator, and Adobe Experience Manager, allowing users to generate content with just a text prompt. For now, you can visit a dedicated website to use it. Beyond basic text-to-image generation, Adobe’s first Firefly model can “transfer” different styles to existing images à la Prisma. Drawing on user-supplied descriptions, it can also apply styles or textures to lettering and fonts.</p>

<p>While Firefly shares similarities with other text-to-image AI models like OpenAI’s DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion, Adobe claims it will sidestep the ethical and logistical issues that have plagued its rivals. These issues include copyright and fair use dilemmas, as well as concerns about objectionable content, biased depictions of gender, ethnicity, and sexuality, and nonconsensual deepfakes.</p>

<p>To avoid copyright and fair use dilemmas, Adobe is training Firefly models exclusively on content from Adobe Stock, the company’s royalty-free media library, along with openly licensed or public domain content where the copyright has expired. In the future, users can even train and fine-tune Firefly models using their own content, steering outputs toward specific styles and design languages.</p>

<p>Adobe is also exploring compensation models for Stock contributors to monetize their talents and benefit from Firefly-generated revenue. It might look something like Shutterstock’s recently-launched Contributors Fund, which reimburses creators whose work is used to train AI art models. Contributors can opt out of training by attaching a “do not train” credentials tag to their work. Adobe is pushing for industry adoption of this tag to ensure models aren’t trained on out-of-bounds content.</p>

<p>Addressing concerns about <a href="https://techwizco.com/ai-art-generator/">AI-generated content</a>, Costin says Firefly models were trained using “carefully curated” and “inclusive” image datasets, with a combination of automated and human moderation and filters to detect and block toxic content. Adobe will regularly update Firefly to improve performance and mitigate harm and bias in its output, allowing users to provide feedback and suggestions.</p>

<p>The introduction of Firefly also raises questions about the impact of generative AI on creators’ ability to benefit from their skills, maintain credit and control over their work, and the viability of generated content in commercial settings. Artists have voiced their discontent with AI-generated art, fearing that it doesn’t properly credit them or that they might be associated with a model that generates objectionable content.</p>

<p>On the second point, Costin says that Adobe employs a range of techniques to detect and block toxic content, including automated and human moderation and filters. History has shown that these sorts of measures can be bypassed, but Costin suggests that it’ll be a carefully guided — if imperfect — learning process. “We’ve made a big investment in models to help prevent bias and harm in the content Firefly generates.</p>

<p>Those models analyze both the prompts and the content to ensure Firefly generates a wide variety of images that represent a balance of cultures and ethnicities, as well as ensuring Firefly does not generate harmful images,” Costin said. “We will regularly update Firefly to improve its performance and mitigate harm and bias in its output. We also provide feedback mechanisms for our users to report potentially biased outputs or provide suggestions into our testing and development processes.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.adobe.com/sensei/generative-ai/firefly.html">Adobe’s Firefly</a> is but one of several initiatives aimed at giving artists more control over their work’s role in generative model training. For instance, DeviantArt has launched a new protection using an HTML tag to prevent web crawlers from downloading images for training sets. AI startup Spawning, in partnership with platforms like ArtStation and Shutterstock, offers a tool allowing artists to remove their images from datasets used to train AI models.</p>

<p>With around 900 members in the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI), Adobe’s proposals stand a good chance of gaining traction. However, artists may still find themselves needing multiple opt-out tools to protect their artwork from being trained on.</p>

<p>Adobe customers must navigate another challenge: determining the rights to Firefly-generated artwork. U.S. federal guidance on the copyright status of AI art remains unclear. Costin acknowledges that the law is currently unsettled, but Adobe believes that using its tools to add “creative input” to a generated image should be enough for creators to obtain copyright.</p>

<p>“As always, creators will need to seek out the copyrights themselves and do what is necessary or required to obtain that ownership,” Costin says, cautiously optimistic. Despite potential setbacks on the copyright or licensing front, Adobe plans to expand Firefly, introducing models that generate illustrations, graphic designs, 3D models, and more.</p>

<p>Adobe’s Firefly is ambitious and, although late to the party, has the advantage of a massive built-in customer base. Creative Cloud boasts 600 million monthly active users, while Experience Cloud has 12,000 customers, including 87% of the Fortune 100. With Acumen Research and Consulting estimating the generative AI market to be worth over $110 billion by 2030, Adobe’s Firefly has the potential to generate significant revenue.</p>

<p>However, only time will tell if Adobe can overcome the numerous hurdles (and competitors) standing in its way, not to mention the costly compute necessary to develop and run new Firefly models. Legal and ethical roadblocks aside, Adobe must make up for lost time and mindshare in a highly competitive field.</p>

<p>Costin remains optimistic, stating that the company is up for the challenge. “Future Firefly models will leverage a variety of assets, tech, and training data from Adobe and others,” he added. “We are designing generative AI to support creators in benefiting from their skills and creativity. By building Firefly directly into our customers’ workflows, we can help creative professionals work more efficiently and spend their time on the higher-value work that they love.”</p>]]></content><author><name>john</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unleash your creativity with Adobe's new AI-powered tool, Firefly, designed to revolutionize content generation and enhance artistic workflows across the Creative Cloud ecosystem.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://techwizco.com/assets/images/ai-news-adobe-firefly.svg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://techwizco.com/assets/images/ai-news-adobe-firefly.svg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">AI Takeover: Apocalypse or Opportunity?</title><link href="https://techwizco.com/news-ai-takeover/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="AI Takeover: Apocalypse or Opportunity?" /><published>2023-03-30T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-03-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://techwizco.com/news-ai-takeover</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://techwizco.com/news-ai-takeover/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="ai-threatens-300-million-jobs---is-yours-on-the-line">AI Threatens 300 Million Jobs - Is Yours on the Line?</h2>

<p>Hey, friends! Can you believe the news that’s been buzzing around? That’s right, Goldman Sachs recently unleashed an eye-opening report suggesting that Artificial Intelligence (AI) might be coming for a staggering 300 million full-time jobs.</p>

<p>Now, if you’re anything like me, this revelation has you pondering whether it’s time to brace for the AI takeover, or maybe even start strategizing on how to ride this technological wave and potentially profit from it.</p>

<p>This just goes to show that no one is immune to the rapid advancements in AI and the potential shifts it may bring to the workforce as we know it. So, buckle up, and let’s explore what this could mean for all of us!</p>

<h2 id="creative-or-doomed-ais-impact-on-various-industries">Creative or Doomed? AI’s Impact on Various Industries</h2>

<p>Okay, let’s talk about how AI is shaking up different industries. I mean, it’s kind of mind-blowing when you think about it. Some people in the creative fields, like graphic design or writing, might be worried that they’ll be out of a job with AI doing all the heavy lifting. But on the flip side, AI could open up a whole new world of possibilities and make their work even more innovative and exciting.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, folks in industries like construction and maintenance are probably breathing a sigh of relief, since AI isn’t likely to replace them anytime soon. So, depending on where you stand, AI could be the best thing since sliced bread or your worst nightmare come to life. Wild, right?</p>

<h2 id="a-brave-new-world-ai-could-boost-global-economy-by-7">A Brave New World: AI Could Boost Global Economy by 7%</h2>

<p>Alright, folks, let’s dive a bit deeper into this report. So, AI is projected to replace around 25% of work tasks in the US and Europe, but there’s a silver lining to this cloud. Many experts argue that this AI revolution could pave the way for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-commits-up-to-35-billion-to-future-of-tech-and-science">fresh job openings</a> and kickstart a productivity surge like never before.</p>

<p>In fact, they’re estimating that the total annual value of goods and services produced around the world could skyrocket by an impressive 7%! A key player in this game is Generative AI - this cutting-edge technology can whip up content that’s just as top-notch as what us humans can create. So, while the AI invasion might be a bit unsettling, it’s also brimming with potential for growth and innovation in ways we can’t even imagine yet.</p>

<h2 id="ai-friend-or-foe-to-the-uk-job-market">AI: Friend or Foe to the UK Job Market?</h2>

<p>The UK government is all about promoting AI investment, claiming that it’ll “ultimately drive productivity across the economy.” Technology Secretary Michelle Donelan reassures us, saying, “We want to make sure that AI is complementing the way we work in the UK, not disrupting it - making our jobs better, rather than taking them away.”</p>

<p>But let’s be real, the impact of AI will differ from sector to sector. The report shows that 46% of tasks in administrative and 44% in legal professions could be automated, but only 6% in construction and 4% in maintenance. Even artists are worried about AI-generated images taking over their jobs.</p>

<h2 id="wage-wars-the-domino-effect-of-ai-on-salaries">Wage Wars: The Domino Effect of AI on Salaries</h2>

<p>Hold up, folks, let’s take a moment to consider Carl Benedikt Frey’s intriguing perspective. As the future-of-work director at Oxford University, he’s got some pretty valid insights to share. Frey suggests that while AI might not kick everyone to the curb, it could still have a significant impact on our paychecks. He explains that, instead of vanishing jobs, AI might just contribute to shrinking wages, as more people with average skills can perform tasks that used to be reserved for experts.</p>

<p>Remember when GPS technology and platforms like Uber burst onto the scene? Frey uses that as an example to illustrate his point. With GPS at their fingertips, anyone could become a driver, and the value of knowing every street in a city like London plummeted. As a result, incumbent drivers took a hit, experiencing wage cuts of around 10%. But guess what? There were still just as many drivers on the road!</p>
