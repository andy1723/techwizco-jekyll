<h3 id="ai-winter">AI Winter</h3>

<p>We should recognize that AI research is a fluctuating process depending on general interest and funding related to it. There is even a term “AI Winter”, which is a period of reduced funding and interest in artificial intelligence (AI) research. AI Winter term was coined in the 1980s to describe a period of time in the 1970s and 1980s when funding for AI research was reduced, leading to a slowdown in progress in the field.</p>

<p>There have been several AI winter[s] since the term was coined, as funding for AI research has tended to fluctuate over time. These downturns in funding are often caused by a combination of factors, such as economic downturns, the failure of AI technologies to meet expectations, and a lack of understanding or appreciation of the potential value of AI research.</p>

<p>During an AI winter, AI research and development may slow down or come to a halt, and researchers and developers in the field may face challenges in finding funding and support for their work. However, these periods of reduced funding and interest are typically followed by periods of renewed interest and growth in the field, as new technologies and approaches are developed and the potential value of AI becomes more widely recognized.</p>

<p>The good news is you don’t have to read through 1063 pages of the official iPhone User Guide - here it is…</p>

<h2 id="iphone-13-initial-setup">iPhone 13 initial setup</h2>

<p>It is simple to get started with your new iPhone. Make sure it’s completely charged, then press the power button and follow the on-screen instructions step by step. However, in order to get the most out of your phone, some additional setup procedures must be completed.</p>

<p>Whether you are making a move from your previous android phone or upgrading your iPhone follow all Apple’s setup procedures without skipping forward. This ensures that your new iPhone is configured in accordance with the manufacturer’s specifications.</p>

<p>Your brand new iPhone is ready to use as soon as you take it out of the box! After a warm “Hello” all that’s left are some basic actions and careful following the simple instructions. If everything is done correctly (or if no errors occur), your new iPhone will have its own personalized settings within minutes.</p>

<p>The good news is that you may set up a Face ID or Touch ID to ensure your safety when it comes to security. Pairing your Apple Watch will allow them to stay connected with all of its functions, including Daily Workouts and Activity Rings!</p>

<p>It’s critical that you enable Face ID, which is the technique for unlocking your new iPhone using a facial scan. You should also educate Siri to recognize your voice so that you may utilize voice commands to perform numerous iPhone tasks. The term “electronic commerce” refers to the sale of goods and services over the internet.</p>

<p>Apple’s setup screens now provide instructions for transferring from an Android phone or an older iPhone. The best way to upgrade from your older iPhone is using Apple’s Quick Start function. It is uncomplicated to use the option to set up your new phone. Contacts, settings, and apps can be remotely transferred from one iPhone to another.</p>

<p>After you’ve configured your iPhone, it’s time to experiment and become acquainted with all of its functions. This iPhone user guide will also assist you in configuring some of the most regularly used functions on your new iPhone, such as emergency features, email, contacts, and calendars, as well as learning about the iPhone camera, Apple Pay, Hey Siri, and other capabilities.</p>

<p>Many other apps will be covered in separate user manuals, including video chat app, health app, camera app, and countless Apple iPhone new features.</p>

<h2 id="iphone-emergency-contact-set-up">iPhone emergency contact set up</h2>

<p>When you’re in trouble, you can use the iPhone 13’s Emergency SOS feature. Press the Wake button and one of the phone’s power buttons at the same time, then use this slider to turn off your phone or dial 911 for medical assistance!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/iPhone-SOS-09.avif" alt="iPhone 13 guide sos setup" /><br />

<p>It’s always a good idea to be ready for emergencies. Apple iPhones may also send a text message with your GPS location and name, allowing you to be identified in an emergency case in an instant! To do so, open your iPhone contacts app, tap the name of the person you want to add to your emergency contacts, and then tap the Add to Emergency Contacts button.</p>

<p>The Apple iOS 15 Emergency SOS slider allows you to swiftly notify authorities of an accident. In addition, if you are unconscious during an accident, paramedics will be able to access your medical information via the Medical ID slider.</p>

<h2 id="iphone-quick-start-data-transfer">iPhone Quick Start data transfer</h2>

<p>If this is not your first iPhone, you will need to transfer your data to the new one. Your previous Apple smartphone must first be backed up. It is possible to accomplish this with any Mac, PC, or iCloud backup solution. If you’d like to back up to iCloud you can do so through the Settings app settings of your device.</p>

<p>Using an Apple Mac to backup Connect your iPhone to a Mac port and backup your phone using Finder or iTunes. You can also use iTunes on a Windows machine for backup. Tomsguide.com has a wonderful step-by-step iPhone backup guide.</p>

<p>When you’ve got your old iPhone backup in place, it’s time to get started with data transfer, which is one of iOS 15’s new capabilities. Check that your previous device is running iOS 11 or later. If necessary, upgrade. Have your old apple smartphone and your new iPhone close to one other. To begin, turn on your iPhone and slide up from the Hello prompt.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that new iPhones have excellent battery life, it is a good idea to connect both iPhones to a power outlet to avoid running out of power in the middle of a transfer procedure.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>First, choose your language and country. Bring your first iPhone close to your new iPhone 13 or iPhone 13 Pro Max when the Quick Start option appears. If you like, you can also use the Set Up Manually option.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the screen, you will notice an option to utilize your Apple ID to set up your new iPhone. Check that the ID is correct and then press the Continue button. If there is no way to proceed, ensure sure Bluetooth is turned on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wait till you see an animation on your new iPhone. Hold your old iPhone over the new one, then center the animation in the viewfinder.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When you see a “Finish” message on your new iPhone follow the onscreen steps.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enter your old phone’s passcode on your new device. Then follow the instructions to set up Face ID or Touch ID on your new iPhone.</p>
  </li>

<h2 id="new-ios-15-features">New iOS 15 features</h2>

<h3 id="focus-mode">Focus Mode</h3>

<p>Your new iPhone has iOS 15 preloaded; but, if you have an earlier Apple iPhone you may easily upgrade to iOS 15. The following Apple phones, as well as future brands, are compatible with iOS 15:</p>

<ul>
  <li>iPhone 13 Pro Max</li>
  <li>iPhone 13 Pro</li>
  <li>iPhone 13</li>
  <li>iPhone 13 mini</li>
  <li>iPhone 12 Pro Max</li>
  <li>iPhone 12 Pro</li>
  <li>iPhone 12</li>
  <li>iPhone 12 mini</li>
  <li>iPhone SE (2020)</li>
  <li>iPhone 11 Pro Max</li>
  <li>iPhone 11 Pro</li>
  <li>iPhone 11</li>
  <li>iPhone XR</li>
  <li>iPhone XS Max</li>
  <li>iPhone XS</li>
  <li>iPhone X</li>

  <li>iPhone 7</li>
  <li>iPhone 6s Plus</li>
  <li>iPhone 6s</li>
  <li>iPhone SE (1st generation)</li>
  <li>iPod touch (7th generation)</li>
</ul>

<p>A Focus mode is one of the new and very helpful features of iOS 15. This function allows you to be busy without being distracted by regular notifications and other disruptions that come with all built-in apps.</p>

<p>When Focus mode is active, you may choose which alerts or notifications from the built-in apps you want to receive. You can also make a selection on how to position your apps on your apple phone depending on what activities you are at it now.</p>

<p>To set up a Focus Mode:</p>

<p>1.Open up your control center by pulling down from the top right corner of your home screen.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/iphone-focus-mode.avif" alt="focus mode" /> <br />

<p>2.Tap on the word “Focus” to set a focus mode. If you tap on the crescent moon icon you will activate Do Not Disturb mode.</p>

<p>3.Select the Focus mode you would like to activate.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/iphone-focus-mode-2-01.avif" alt="find focus mode" /> <br />

<p>4.Tap on three dots next to the focus to set up a specific time for this mode. You can also set this mode until you leave your current location.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/iphone-personal-focus-mode-01.avif" alt="personal focus mode" /> <br />
Source techwizco.com</p>

<p>You may also configure your iPhone to receive notifications in Focus from specified apps and persons. Your phone’s Home screen can also be changed for a Focus. Here is one of the greatest user manuals by tomsguide.com that explains in depth how to set up Focus mode on your Apple iPhone.</p>

<h3 id="home-screen-widgets">Home Screen Widgets</h3>

<p>Widgets, which were initially brought to the iPhone home screen with iOS 14 and are still available in the iOS 15th edition of the operating system preinstalled on your device. A widget is a fragment from an app that displays information at a glance; this saves you from having to start them or sift through all accessible information when you simply want something quick! On my main screen, I have weather and stock market apps that indicate current circumstances.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/iphone-widgets-01.avif" alt="iphone widgets" /> <br />
Source techwizco.com</p>

<p>Widgets are a simple and appealing way to display useful information on your home screen. What’s the best part? They may be stacked together to form what Apple refers to as a Smart Stack, which includes built-in apps! One of my favorite examples is how they’ve designed it so you don’t have to check the widget box every single day - instead, these dynamic pieces alter themselves based upon whatever crucial material might crop up that morning (like meetings).</p>

<p>Your iPhone 13 is much more helpful with the new widgets. Third-party app developers have been granted a year by Apple to create their own interactive mobile apps and add them as configurable shortcuts on top of built-in ones like Caller ID or Camera app!</p>

<h3 id="safari-tab-bar-adjustment">Safari Tab Bar Adjustment</h3>

<p>When iOS 15 was released, many people weren’t aware that Apple had moved the tab bar from its traditional position at the top right of the web page down below. This made Safari more convenient for one-handed use on larger iPhones because you can now easily reach with your thumb rather than having to move up and down between different screens like before! It is particularly useful on larger phones like iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro, and iPhone 13 Pro Max.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/iphone-safari-tab-bar-01.avif" alt="safari tab bar" /> <br />
Source techwizco.com</p>

<p>If you don’t like this change, you can easily reverse it. Enter Safari, press “aA” on the left side of the tab bar, and then select Show Top Address Bar from the pop-up menu that displays after making a selection - no more annoying navigation buttons!</p>

<h3 id="photographic-styles">Photographic styles</h3>

<p>The new Photographic Styles feature in the iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro, and iPhone 13 Pro Max elevates images to new heights. You can now modify your photos before you take them, providing folks an opportunity for some truly unique images they might not have thought about trying otherwise! This function enables you see your picture’s appearance before you use the shutter button.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/iphone-photo-style-01.avif" alt="iphone photo style" /> <br />
Source techwizco.com</p>

<p>If you look at one of the apple user guides you’ll find explanations on how to choose a photographic style. And it is a pretty easy process. Your camera is set to the standard option by default and to choose the style open your camera and tap ⌃ , tap an image stack and swipe left to see the different styles. You can choose from:</p>

<p>Rich Contrast: Darker shadows, richer colors, and stronger contrast create a dramatic look.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Vibrant: Wonderfully bright and vivid colors create a brilliant yet natural look.</li>
  <li>Warm: Golden undertones create a warmer look.</li>
  <li>Cool: Blue undertones create a cooler look.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also customize the effects of the styles by adjusting their color and warmth.</p>

<h3 id="cinematic-mode">Cinematic Mode</h3>

<p>With the new Cinematic Mode and extra cameras on the iPhone 13 series pro models, you can now create Hollywood-style videos. When you enable this function, your footage has a depth of field and automatically focuses based on what’s happening in the video - so if someone turns towards another person for a chat, they’ll become clearer than before!</p>

<p>Cinematic Setting, among other photographic styles, is a new, dedicated mode in the camera app for the iPhone 13. It is accessible alongside Video and Portrait shots while recording video! The focus will now move to whatever you tap on - thus if your video topic isn’t crisp enough, for example, simply pressing again will remedy that problem without requiring any extra video edits from you by using this useful apple tool.</p>

<h3 id="notifications">Notifications</h3>

<p>Notifications in iOS 15 are significantly more orderly and properly classified. Notifications can now be grouped by service, app, or person, which was not possible prior to iOS 15. The new notification options in iOS 15 are more customizable than ever! You may now specify which applications send them notifications and when they wish to be notified.</p>

<p>Furthermore, with the ability to disable system-wide or individual Focus, you can regulate how much information distractions bring into your life—ideal if there’s anything specific going on right now that requires attention but shouldn’t take over everything else.</p>

<p>But who has time to look through hundreds of notifications every day if you’re a busy person? Notification summaries are here to keep your information private! Instead of being bombarded with alerts throughout the day from low-priority sources like Facebook or emails about what’s going on in politics right now (which may or may not be of interest to us), we can now choose how many messages make up each summary; when they appear at specific times throughout the day—and whether or not we want these updates delivered straight to our phones without any additional intervention required.</p>

<h3 id="visual-look-up">Visual Look Up</h3>

<p>iOS 15 for iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro, and iPhone 13 Pro Max brought new smart camera functions - Visual Look Up and Live Text.</p>

<p>Give your photographs a dose of much-needed context with Visual Look Up! Simply swipe up on an image in any program that displays digital photographs, such as the iBooks Store or Mail App. You’ll get information about where it was taken and what’s going down right now — even if they’re plants…or animals. Don’t worry, this also works when browsing messages and websites accessed via links within such apps.</p>

<p>Another very useful iOS 15 feature that works on iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro, and iPhone 13 Pro Max is Live Text. It is a life saver if you need to copy a large portion of text from a screenshot or a picture and have to type it all manually.</p>

<p>Apart from being able to read a qr code, Live Text lets you copy any text from your pictures or even from your camera and paste this text into a text field of any app that permits this action.</p>

<p>The good news is Live text can recognize typed and handwritten text details and understands several foreign languages including Chinese, Spanish, and German. This option also works in the Safari browser and in any app that you can use to type in. In those apps, you can use a Scan Text option.</p>

<p>When you click on Scan Text the phone camera will be activated and you’ll be able to scan all text details right into your message.</p>

<h3 id="share-play">Share play</h3>

<p>It’s difficult to detach from life in a society where we’re continually on our phones. But with FaceTime video chat app updates in iOS 15 and new features such as SharePlay that let you listen and watch films or share your screen with others during sessions without having any form of disruption from other apps that are operating in the background as before.</p>

<p>During a FaceTime chat, Share Play allows you to view movies and TV shows with your pals while conversing and sharing your screen. This option is available on all iPhone 13 models, including the iPhone 13 mini.</p>

<p>The good news is that SharePlay works with TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Fitness+, as well as many popular apps such as NBA, TikTok, Twitch, Paramount+, and SHOWTIME. Users can utilize Share Play to watch Apple TV on the big screen while conversing with friends on their iPhone or iPad.</p>

<h3 id="iphone-13-pro-max-camera">iPhone 13 Pro Max camera</h3>

<p>There are three cameras on the back of the iPhone 13 Pro and one on the front of the larger iPhone 13 Pro Max. There are three cameras on the back: a 12MP wide, a 12MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom, and a 12MP ultrawide. On the front is a 12MP wide camera. In comparison to earlier versions, there are several new design components, such as a reduced notch, etc.</p>

<p>To give high quality movies with moving focus effects, details, and tricks, both phone cameras have a night mode with a LIDAR scanner, Dolby vision HDR 4K, macro mode, and cinematic mode.</p>

<p>Here are the key camera specs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Primary: 12 MP sensor, 1.9µm pixels, 26 mm equivalent f/1.5-aperture lens, sensor shift OIS</li>

Because of the benefits, businesses are migrating from other hosts to Convesio. In this section, we will discuss why your organization should consider using Convesio for WordPress hosting and what benefits you may expect.</p>

<h2 id="what-convesio-next-generation-wordpress-hosting-is-about">What Convesio next generation WordPress hosting is about?</h2>

<p>Convesio, being a cloud-based hosting platform, offers WordPress users the most up-to-date web technology. In contrast to typical solutions, Convesio’s multi-tenant environment allows each website on their system to be backed up by redundant data storage clusters, as well as having offshore backup options for those who desire it! You can also improve the performance of your sites by substantially scaling PHP run time and, if necessary, using auto-healing architecture solutions.</p>

<p>WordPress hosting at its finest Convesio is a platform that combines open source software and proprietary code to solve a single problem: operating WordPress in large-scale environments. The solution includes built-in features such as Cloudflare Enterprise, which improves performance while delivering an extra layer of security to your website before requests even reach the servers!</p>

<p>Convesio is a hybrid cloud solution that handles your WordPress demands by overcoming the problems associated with hosting it on scalable environments. With high availability and elastic scalability in mind, it has been deployed across Google Cloud, AWS, and Steadfast platforms.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-managed-wordpress-hosting">What is managed WordPress hosting?</h2>

<p>Managed WordPress hosting is a dedicated environment intended for speed, high availability, scalability, and security when just running WordPress.</p>

<p>Managed WordPress hosting simply implies that you are not responsible for any underlying infrastructure, such as web server updates, backups, security checks, and so on. It is typically faster, more secure, and contains extra services such as automatic backups.</p>

<p>Because Convesio managed WordPress hosting includes load balancers, a cache layer, built-in edge caching, HTTP/2, and CDN technologies, your website will load significantly faster than on standard shared hosting.</p>

<p>Convesio is a proprietary design that allows your site (and hence all of its contents) to scale automatically if you need to handle high volumes of traffic. The system runs in several containers on multiple servers to handle any demand - even an unexpected surge!</p>

<h2 id="benefits-of-using-best-wordpress-hosting-convesio">Benefits Of Using Best WordPress Hosting Convesio</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>High Avalability</strong> Convesio’s powerful load-balancer containers ensure that your site is always available. As a result, you can be confident that yours will always be up and running, even during peak hours when other websites may encounter downtime!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Horizontal Autoscaling</strong> - When the number of visitors to your website increases, Convesio’s auto-scaling mechanism automatically expands the server farm with more virtual servers. This saves you money because you won’t need a system administrator for this work, and it also improves performance because resources are controlled dynamically instead!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>WordPress speed optimization</strong> - Let’s face it, your website needs to be fast, dependable, and simple for customers/clients (and potential ones!) to navigate; but most importantly, they want the site load times on their devices or browsers to be low enough so things feel snappy with no lag at all! Convesio WordPress hosting analyzes how much capacity YOU require with our free performance optimization analysis…we’ll even show you where areas could benefit from some modifications so you don’t have to worry about having additional hardware later on.</p>
  </li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Page Caching</strong> Convesio’s cache is entirely custom-built and designed from the ground up for WordPress. Because the platform is entirely made up of novel features, no WordPress plugins are necessary! With con successive layers such as time to live settings or exception rules, you can control page level storage on your website to ensure that all data remains fresh even if someone returns later without having previously visited it - this way, their visit will be faster due to less reloading/refreshing required at each step through pages while they browse around.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Automated backups</strong> - With a single click, you can configure advanced backup and retention settings, including how frequently backups should be performed and how long each kind should be stored. Backup periods can range from 24 hours to 180 days - that’s a lot more control than most people realize! You can also utilize your backup to set up a staging WordPress site.</p>

However, there are some restrictions, so don’t be disheartened if it’s not ideal right away - give them time and see how things go before making any final conclusions about this firm or any services they provide.</p>

<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong> - Convesio has some extremely great features available only with their managed WordPress hosting.

Having said that, Convesio engineers are always willing to assist when needed!</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-docker-platform-and-why-does-it-matter">What is a Docker Platform and why does it matter</h2>

<p>This is why it’s so crucial to have a few different servers for your websites. If one goes down or becomes overburdened, you may still give outstanding service by switching over all the sites on that particular machine rather than losing patience with waiting periods while trying other solutions such as relocating their domain name!</p>

<p>A typical but easily avoidable issue is server failure, which can occur when every single website created under one administrative account is hosted at the same physical location, resulting in hundreds, if not thousands, of calls seeking immediate response.</p>

<p>Convesio has discovered a solution to the problem of site hosting by utilizing Docker containers. With no downtime, this innovative technology will give you more room on your server, faster speeds, and better security than ever before.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Docker is a software platform that allows you to package and run your applications in containers on the same operating system as their hosts. The primary distinction between this strategy and standard virtual machines is found in two factors: The overhead associated with managing different instances is frequently not worth it; isolation—because everything operates inside one cohesive unit, there are no security issues associated with merely running several workloads concurrently.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You may have an up-to-date website in seconds with container services. This is accomplished by software virtualization, which enables the service to run numerous apps concurrently on a single server without slowing down or crashing any of them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Convesio’s hosting solution is more useful than other virtual server providers because of its versatility. You can host an unlimited number of websites on the autoscaling Docker environment with a single account.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Container technology transforms websites by eliminating the danger of website failure and making traffic balancing easier. Docker containers, because they are built on several servers, are an ideal approach to ensure that your website and data are safe in the event of a disaster.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Convesio provides numerous containers for each customer that may be automatically scaled up or down in response to traffic levels. These quick-scaling, simple management capabilities assist you in meeting your high availability and scalability requirements!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="shared-hosting">Shared Hosting</h3>

<p>Shared hosting services are ideal for small or medium-sized websites because they offer the same resources as other WordPress accommodation sites. The primary distinction is that shared web hosting allow numerous sites to share a single server, as well as storage and bandwidth.</p>

<p>Shared hosting might be an excellent method to reduce your web hosting costs, but it comes at the expense of performance. Depending on how many websites they host on the same server, services may overwhelm and slow down for other customers as well.</p>

<h3 id="vps-hosting">VPS Hosting</h3>

<p>When you begin to experience bandwidth limitations and other limitations associated with shared hosting, it is time to upgrade. The logical next step would be to sign up for VPS hosting.

<h2 id="convesio-wordpress-hosting-faqs">Convesio WordPress Hosting FAQ’s</h2>

<p><strong>2. How Convesio is different from shared hosting providers?</strong></p>

<p>Convesio offers WordPress hosting with bespoke scalability and performance. It does not support any other content management systems or code outside of the framework, which is why the service was designed to make installing pluggable themes on the Convesio minimalist environment as simple as possible.</p>

<p><strong>3. Is cPanel available on the platform?</strong></p>

<p>Convesio offers a bespoke implementation of components such as PHP, Percona, and GlusterFS for running high performance WordPress sites. This implies that, unlike other web servers, it does not employ traditional control panels; instead, it provides an easy-to-use interface with 24/7 help available at any time if needed.</p>

<p><strong>4. What companies Convesio uses for its datacenter?</strong></p>

<p>Convesio’s tech stack can be deployed on both the cloud and bare metal servers, making them perfect for any environment. For its infrastructure Covesio currently uses Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform-Powered Enterprise Edition(GCP PE) &amp; Steadfast Systems’ proprietary offering.</p>

<p><strong>5. What are the geographical locations of Convesio servers?</strong></p>

<p>Currently, Convesio clusters are implemented in North America, Europe, and Australia.</p>

<p><strong>6. How is Convesio container usage different from other hosting providers?</strong></p>

<p>Here is an explanation <a href="https://convesio.com/faq/">from Convesio</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Other popular providers do take advantage of containers, but in a very different way than Convesio. Effectively they are using containers as the next generation VPS. All the components of your site run inside a single scalable container. This creates an environment similar to a traditional VPS with all the normal Single Points of Failure associated with WordPress. We have a container based architecture that is scalable at several different layers. For instance, your WordPress runtime, which is just your PHP Instance, can scale separately from your DB Instance and our Load Balancers.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>When your site comes under heavy load, these other container based systems can scale up your resources increasing RAM, CPU, etc to handle the load. Convesio’s architecture uses a scale out process to replicate your site running in multiple containers, all attached to a multi-node Percona XtraDB Cluster. The advantage of our system is we have the ability to run your site on multiple servers simultaneously, which greatly increases redundancy and scaling capacity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>7. Does Convesio support WordPress Multisite?</strong></p>

<p>Currently, Convesio does not support this feature.</p>

<p><strong>8. Can A WordPress site run on multiple containers?</strong></p>

<p>A website can be run in one single PHP runtime container or multiple containers. Each has its own set number of workers and vcores, so if your site is processor intensive with a lot of visitors you should run it from the start on multiple containers.</p>

<h2 id="is-convesio-the-greatest-wordpress-hosting-company">Is Convesio the greatest WordPress hosting company?</h2>

This how-to guide will help you through the process of setting up your own own Plex server.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-beast-plex-server">What is a Beast Plex Server?</h3>

<p>All your video, audio, and other visual information is stored, organized, and streamed by the Plex Media Server. Server clients are playback apps that can be installed on a wide range of devices and web browsers.</p>

<p>Plex Media Server is the name of the back-end component, which is free (you do not need to subscribe to a Plex pass account to use it). It can receive content from files, iTunes, iPhoto, Aperture, or the internet and then organize it into a library based on metadata tags like title, artist, album, genre, year, and popularity.</p>

<p>It organizes audio and video content from personal media libraries and streams it to the player, either locally or over a LAN, depending on the user’s preference. Plex works with a variety of operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and FreeBSD, as well as NAS and the Nvidia Shield TV.</p>

<p>The player apps utilized on the front end include Plex Web App, Plexamp, and Plex Dash. They let the user to manage and play any and all content saved on the Plex Media Server. The great majority of apps are free to download.</p>

<p>Users with free Plex accounts can access Plex, Inc.’s content collection, which includes ad-supported video on demand and free-to-stream live TV channels. These free accounts also enable users to share their personal media libraries with friends or among their own device collection.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/build-your-own-beast-plex-server.avif" alt="Build your own beast plex server" />Source plex.tv</p>

<h3 id="plex-media-server-hardware-requirements">Plex Media Server hardware requirements</h3>

<p>It is critical to adhere to the Plex hardware specifications while building your own beast plex server. Your beast plex server can be run on a desktop computer, server hardware, or a NAS storage device such as Drobo, Netgear, or Synology. A complete Plex NAS compatibility guide <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MfYoJkiwSqCXg8cm5-Ac4oOLPRtCkgUxU0jdj3tmMPc/edit#gid=1274624273">may be found here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="beast-plex-servers-cpu-requirements">Beast Plex Servers CPU requirements</h3>

<p>The minimum CPU requirements for Plex servers are Intel Core i3, but this is dependent on how many people are accessing content at the same time. Because the server may need transcoding of content during playback at times, you may require something quicker than the minimum.</p>

<p>If your computer’s CPU cannot keep up with transcoding your media, you will notice halting or buffering while the app waits for the server to catch up.</p>

<p>The most important thing to remember is that the more Plex programs that are playing content at the same time, the more processing power is required. When you have two Plex apps operating at the same time, each of which requires transcoded content, the amount of processing power required by your computer’s central processing unit (CPU) nearly doubles when only one program is playing video.</p>

<p>Flex suggests the following CPU specs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>No transcoding: “Atom” 1.2GHz (NAS based on ARM processors)</li>
  <li>Single 720p transcode: Intel i3 3.0 GHz</li>
  <li>Single 1080p transcode: Intel Core i5 3.0GHz</li>
  <li>Single 4K transcode: Intel Core i7 3.2GHz</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="beast-plex-server-memory-requirements">Beast Plex Server memory requirements</h3>

<p>In most cases, Plex Media Server does not need a significant amount of memory (RAM) to provide the service. In most cases, 2 gigabytes of memory is more than adequate. Some installations, particularly those based on Linux, can often run without even that much memory. Having more RAM won’t hurt you in any way, and it will definitely be helpful if you’re using the computer for a variety of tasks at the same time.</p>

<h3 id="is-it-a-good-idea-to-build-your-own-beast-plex-server-on-a-nas">Is it a good idea to build your own beast plex server on a NAS?</h3>

<p>Plex Media Server operating on a network attached storage (NAS) device may be an ideal alternative for some users, but it is not always appropriate for all situations.</p>

<p>The fact that most consumer NAS do not have particularly powerful CPUs is going to be the most aggravating limitation for most customers. In other cases, the mobile device will be powered by an ARM-based processor that lacks any capacity or capabilities for content transcoding.</p>

<p>On other cases, it may run on an Intel processor that is theoretically capable of transcoding but is too slow to transcode at a rate adequate for the majority of applications.</p>

<p>If you want to run your beast plex server on a NAS, you may read a pretty extensive <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/201373793-is-plex-media-server-on-a-nas-right-for-me/">article here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-install-and-build-your-own-beast-plex-server">How to install and build your own beast plex server</h3>

<p>Plex installation is comparable to other software installations, with the exception that you must first install the server software. Once this is completed, you can begin using Plex. Following that, you must install programs on each of your devices in order for them to connect to the server.</p>

<p>Organizing your numerous sources of media is a potentially critical step. As you set up your Plex Material Server, you will begin the process of establishing libraries for your media, such as movies, television shows, music, photographs, and home videos.</p>

<p>Plex will recognize and match material like as movies and TV shows when you do this. It will then collect information such as movie poster artwork, movie casts, and TV episode descriptions, among other things, to beautify your collections.</p>

<h4 id="choosing-a-server-and-performance-considerations">Choosing a server and performance considerations</h4>

<p>Plex Media Server is compatible with computers running Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux; some users run it on their primary computer, while others deploy it on a separate machine. It is also possible to install it on a NAS, provided that it is compatible. In general, Plex runs without any issues on the majority of modern computers.</p>

<p>Keep in mind two important points for providing a good plex media server performance.</p>

<h4 id="media-users">Media Users</h4>

<p>To begin, the Plex Media Server may broadcast material to several users’ devices at the same time. Assume that everyone in your family is watching a film or other sort of media on Plex at the same time, which consumes more server resources. As a result, the server’s power must be increased in proportion to the number of individuals viewing material at the same time.</p>

<h4 id="bandwidth">Bandwidth</h4>

<p>Second, when Plex optimizes your media files for specific devices or available bandwidth, it converts (or “transcodes”) the content while it is playing. This needs a tremendous amount of server resources, but it allows you to access all of your stuff, regardless of size, on all of your devices, regardless of size.</p>

<p>Problems with playback, such as stuttering, buffering, or even failure to play at all, indicate that your server lacks the processing power required for the manner you utilize it.</p>

<p>When this happens, it almost always means that the central processing unit (CPU) is struggling to keep up with the number of users, the amount of transcoding, or both. As a result, you should seriously consider updating your gear. It’s also possible that your hardware is fine, but your connection’s speed is the issue.</p>

<h4 id="download-your-beast-plex-server">Download your beast plex server</h4>

<p>Once you’ve selected where you’ll install the Plex Media Server, go to the <a href="https://plex.tv/downloads/">Plex Downloads website</a> and download the server for your device from there. Make sure you select the correct plex server software for your operating system.</p>

<p>It is critical to ensure that the computer acting as the server has an active internet connection during the installation procedure. The setup wizard will then work properly, and you will be able to create an account as it does so.</p>

<h4 id="download-a-plex-player-app">Download a Plex Player App</h4>

<p>While you’re on the Downloads page, you might wish to install a player app for your device. The browser-based Plex Web App is provided with the server; however, to use it on other devices, you will most likely need to download an app.</p>

<p>The beast plex server apps are available for desktops running Windows and Mac OS, mobile devices running Android and iOS, and connected devices such as Amazon Fire TV, Android TV, Roku, Smart TVs, gaming consoles, and so on.</p>

<h3 id="you-beast-plex-server-installation">You beast plex server installation</h3>

<p>The server is compatible with a wide range of operating systems and platforms. Installation is always performed using an installation package and follows the platform’s regular installation method. When working with NAS, it is critical to follow the manufacturer’s add-on installation instructions.</p>

<h4 id="beast-plex-server-on-windows">Beast Plex Server on Windows</h4>

<p>Download the installer file with an.exe file extension to install your beast plex server on Windows 10 or Windows 11.</p>

<p>Run the installer and proceed with the standard Windows 10 installation procedure. After the installation is complete, click the “Launch” button or use the Start button to launch the Beast plex server.</p>

<p>It is time to perform a beast plex software initial configuration when the server has been activated and displays a System Tray icon (the one at the bottom right of the screen). Simply select “Open Plex…” from the Plex system tray menu.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/beast-plex-servre-initial-configuration.avif" alt="Best Plex Server on Windows" /></p>

<h4 id="beast-plex-server-on-mac-os">Beast Plex Server on Mac OS</h4>

<p>To build your own beast plex server on Mac OS, download the Plex Media Server software .zip file, unzip the file, and drag the beast plex app to your Mac Applications folder.</p>

<p>After launching the media server from the Application folder, you can begin initial server setup by clicking on “Open Plex…” from the “&gt;” icon.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/beast-plex-server-initial-setup-on-mac.avif" alt="Beast Plex Server on Mac" />Source plex.tv</p>

<h4 id="beast-plex-server-on-linux">Beast Plex Server on Linux</h4>

<p>To install the Beast Plex server on Fedora/CentOS download the .rpm package with a current version and run “sudo yum install plexmediaserver-x.xx.x.xxxx.x86_64.rpm”. To proceed with the initial server setup, open a browser on the same server and go to http://localhost:32400/web.</p>

<p>To install Beast server on Ubuntu, download the .deb package and run “sudo dpkg -i plexmediaserver-x.xx.x.xxxx.x86_64.deb”. To set up the server, go to the same URL as shown above for the Fedora installation.</p>

<p>By default, the Beast Media Server runs in the context of the user “plex.” Your media directories and files must allow the plex user to read and execute files in order for plex to work properly.</p>

<h4 id="your-beast-server-on-a-network-attached-storage">Your Beast server on a Network Attached Storage</h4>

<p>Download the installation package for your particular NAS and follow your hardware specific installation instructions to install the server. Go to http://nas.ip.address:32400/web address to configure your server.</p>

<h3 id="to-open-the-streaming-web-app-on-a-different-computer">To open the streaming web app on a different computer</h3>

<h4 id="on-the-same-local-network">On the same local network</h4>

<p>If your other computer is on the same local network as your server, you can simply open a browser window, go to the following address, http://local.server.ip.address:32400/web, and you will be connected to the server.</p>

<h4 id="on-a-different-network">On a different network</h4>

<p>If your client is remote on a different network, you have to go through a slightly more complicated procedure of setting up an SSH tunnel to initially configure your server.</p>

<h5 id="ssh-tunnel-on-mac-os-or-linux">SSH tunnel on Mac OS or Linux</h5>

<p>You are going to use a command line on the terminal to configure the tunnel. So, open your terminal and enter the following command: “ssh -L 8888:127.0.0.1:32400 your.server.ip.address”. Now, in your browser, open the following address “http://127.0.0.1:8888/web” and you will be connected to the server.</p>

<h5 id="ssh-tunnel-on-windows">SSH tunnel on Windows</h5>

<p>If your client and the server both use Windows, they support RDP protocol features, and you can connect using a Remote Desktop session.</p>

<p>However, if your server is based on Mac OS or Linux, you would need to use either the built-in SSH client that support SSH tunneling or a Putty application to configure the tunnel. For Putty connection you have to specify a gateway, which is your.server.ip.address, source port 8888, and your destination 127.0.0.1:32400. After everything is set, you can reach your server via your browser at the address http://127.0.0.1:8888/web.</p>

<h3 id="your-media-collection">Your Media Collection</h3>

<p>Finally, properly structuring your media collection is the most crucial step in offering exceptional multimedia server capabilities.</p>

<p>Your media should have a specified file structure that is distinct for media in their own directories, stand-alone media files, and numerous editions in order for the media server to perform properly.</p>

<p>Please see the <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/categories/your-media/">Plex full media organization tutorial</a> for help with naming and arranging your music, TV show, and personal media files, as well as employing subtitles.</p>

<h3 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion</h3>

<p>Adding a Beast Plex server to your home network is a great way to increase the storage capacity of your personal media library while also making streaming content easier than ever.</p>

<p>If you use the official Beast Plex application, you will not have access to additional capabilities such as transcoding and background playback. However, if you build your own Beast Plex server, you will be able to tailor it to match your needs while adhering to any constraints you may have.</p>]]></content><author><name>andre</name></author><category term="How To" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Build Your Own Beast Plex Server to run your own streaming video services.

These files can be created at a number of bit rates, allowing you to strike a balance between file quality and total size. Because of the short file size, it has quickly become the most popular method of sending files over the internet. Because all modern browsers support this format, it is the optimum audio file format for both browsers and other media players.</p>

<p>You want to turn a video you saw into a song, but you don’t know how. We understand. It’s possible that you’d prefer to download a video in audio format so that you may listen to it on your iPod, PC, or smartphone later. Converting YouTube videos to MP3 can be difficult if you don’t have the correct tool.</p>

<p>As a result, we’ve produced a list of our top YouTube to MP3 converter suggestions so you can extract the audio from a YouTube video like a true pro. However, before we get to the list of some of the top YouTube MP3 downloaders, let’s start with the basics.</p>

<h3 id="what-youtube-mp3-converter-does">What YouTube MP3 Converter Does</h3>

<p>A “YouTube to MP3 converter” or an online converter can convert the audio from a YouTube video so that it can be stored in MP3 format and quickly retrieved when needed.</p>

<p>When you utilize a YouTube downloader, you can avoid the need for an active internet connection to listen to your favorite YouTube video. This also makes it much easier to share audio files with others.</p>

<p>You can also convert individual episodes of video podcasts into MP3 audio files, download them, and then publish them to a podcast if you make video podcasts. This will allow you to reach a broader audience and increase the visibility of your work. All at no cost!</p>

<h3 id="how-to-choose-right-free-youtube-to-mp3-converter">How To Choose Right Free Youtube To Mp3 Converter</h3>

<p>Creators and marketers are aware of the value that YouTube possesses. However, a powerful tool is required in order to convert YouTube videos into audio tracks. There is no one tool that can meet the needs of everyone searching for a YouTube downloader. However, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:</p>

<h4 id="youtube-mp3-conversion-options">Youtube MP3 Conversion Options</h4>

<p>MP3 downloaders for YouTube now provide a slew of useful functions. Conduct a needs analysis before selecting a tool with the characteristics you require. Is the program, for example, compatible with several formats, such as MP3, MP4, and WAV, in case you need to convert your YouTube videos to one of those formats?</p>

<p>Can you make changes to the clips before downloading the audio? Some users may need to employ batch processing if they wish to convert YouTube videos to MP3.</p>

<p>On the other hand, some folks may require a simple tool that can perform the conversion successfully. So, decide out what you require and hunt for a downloader that can provide it.</p>

<h4 id="youtube-to-mp3-audio-quality">Youtube To MP3 Audio Quality</h4>

<p><img src="/assets/images/youtube-mp3-audio-quality.avif" alt="MP3 audio quality" />Source fossbytes.com</p>

<p>The finest Youtube to MP3 converters create MP3 files to compensate for any audio loss that occurs during the conversion. JPEG, on the other hand, is a lossless standard for compressing images, whereas MP3 is a lossy format for compressing sound.</p>

<p>When lossy formats are employed, the overall quality of the raw audio that was originally captured is always poorer. You can change this so that you are not aware of the difference. However, doing so will result in a greater file size overall.</p>

<p>When it comes to digital audio, MP3 isn’t as crucial as it once was because new electronic gadgets have so much more storage capacity. And Internet connections have so much more bandwidth. Lossy audio compression is no longer necessary thanks to formats like FLAC, which allow you to save files without sacrificing quality.</p>

<p>Even with codecs that do not lose quality, digital audio will always have some quality loss. Even if the ordinary listener cannot detect. This is due to the fact that digital encoding is constrained in terms of bandwidth and sampling, such as the 44.1 kHz sampling rate used in CDs.</p>

<h4 id="youtube-to-mp3-conversion-speed">Youtube to mp3 conversion speed</h4>

<p>Another critical component is the conversion rate provided by the tool. The YouTube MP3 downloader you choose should be able to swiftly convert YouTube videos to MP3 format. It is vital to remember that spending a large amount of time converting videos may affect overall productivity in the long term. Find a converter that works quickly. A competent tool should be able to accomplish the task in between 30 seconds and 2 minutes, depending on the length of the video.</p>

<h4 id="youtube-to-mp3-converter-supported-formats">Youtube to mp3 converter supported formats</h4>

<p>A Youtube to MP3 converter’s primary job is to convert videos to mp3 files. However, ensure that the converter you use can also convert to other popular file formats.</p>

<p>You should be able to convert not just to mp3, but also to other popular audio and video file formats such as MP4, WAV, OGG, PLAC, AAC, and so on.</p>

<h4 id="desktop-or-browser-based-mp3-converters">Desktop or browser based mp3 converters</h4>

<p>When looking for a free YouTube video to MP3 converter, one of the first things you should consider is the total number of videos you want to convert. If you are just going to do this task once or twice, you might probably consider using an online tool. If you require more advanced capabilities, you should consider downloading a specialized desktop app.</p>

<p>Desktop software will also be faster because the data will not be handled on a remote server. Additionally, some apps can convert multiple YouTube videos to MP3 format at the same time.</p>

<p>Because these apps are so popular, it’s crucial to exercise caution when looking for a YouTube to MP3 converter. Malicious malware is not unusual. We are confident in suggesting the tools in this guide because they have all been well tested.</p>

<h3 id="youtube-to-mp3-converter-safety">Youtube to mp3 converter safety</h3>

<p>There are free YouTube to MP3 converters that are safe to use, but there are also a lot that aren’t. Also, there are converters that you can use without risk, but they come with software you don’t need. Some of these pop-up ads could be harmful or lead to fake websites whose main goal is to steal your personal information.</p>

<p>Because of this, you can’t download a free MP3 converter without first reading reviews online. Some of them come with bloatware that takes up space on your hard drive and CPU bandwidth. All of the ones on our list have been checked and found to be completely safe.</p>

<h3 id="youtube-videos-to-mp3-legalities">Youtube Videos to MP3 Legalities</h3>

<p>Unless you subscribe to Youtube Music Premium or Youtube Premium, converting YouTube to MP3 is a violation of the YouTube terms of service. You may not copy, reproduce, distribute, transmit, broadcast, display, sell, license, or otherwise exploit any content for any other purpose without the prior written approval of Youtube.</p>

<p>Youtube’s terms of service encourage you to watch or listen to its content via the Youtube website or a Youtube app. For example, if you have iOS 16 on your phone, you can keep watching/listening to YouTube videos even if a YouTube app is running in the background.</p>

<p>Using an mp3 converter to convert YouTube to mp3 is comparable to the practice of recording radio music to tape cassettes for personal use in the 1980s and 1990s. Of course, when you use an mp3 converter to convert YouTube to mp3, the procedure is clearly traceable and can be used against you.</p>

<p>If you decide to download YouTube video mp3 files, apply common sense and seek professional legal guidance if necessary.</p>
