Jensen just announced the arrival of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/keynote">NVIDIA AI Foundations</a> - the new game changer in the world of enterprise AI! This is definitely something worth discussing and getting excited about!</p>

<p>The world of AI is rapidly evolving and changing the way we work and interact with technology. The potential of AI to transform the enterprise landscape is huge, and NVIDIA AI Foundations is at the forefront of this transformation.</p>

<p>So, what exactly is NVIDIA AI Foundations, and what makes it so exciting? Let’s dive deeper and explore the features and benefits of this groundbreaking platform.</p>

<h3 id="foundation-model-as-a-service">Foundation Model as a Service</h3>

<p>One of the most exciting features of NVIDIA AI Foundations is the Foundation Model as a Service. This new service allows you to get your very own AI model customized specifically for your proprietary data.</p>

<p>This is a game changer because it means that you can get the exact solution that you need for your specific business problem. This is particularly important because off-the-shelf AI models may not be sufficient to meet the unique requirements of your business.</p>

<p>With the Foundation Model as a Service, NVIDIA is making it possible for businesses to leverage the power of AI in a way that is tailored to their specific needs.</p>

<h3 id="multimodal-platform">Multimodal Platform</h3>

<p>Another exciting feature of NVIDIA AI Foundations is the multimodal platform. This platform allows you to use not just text, but also images, videos, and even 3D data to build custom multimodal LLM and generative models that fit your specific use case.</p>

<p>This is particularly important because many businesses have complex problems that cannot be solved with a single mode of data. By using a multimodal approach, businesses can build more robust and accurate AI models that can solve a wider range of problems.</p>

<p>The multimodal platform also means that businesses can leverage the power of AI in new and innovative ways. For example, a company that sells furniture could use AI to help customers visualize how a piece of furniture would look in their home using 3D data.</p>

<h3 id="exciting-partnerships">Exciting Partnerships</h3>

<p>NVIDIA AI Foundations has already partnered with big names in the industry such as Getty Images, Shutterstock, and Adobe. This means that businesses can get access to the high-quality data sets they need to build AI models that are accurate and useful.</p>

<p>Partnerships like these are important because they help to overcome one of the biggest challenges in building effective AI models - access to high-quality data. By partnering with companies that have access to large amounts of data, NVIDIA AI Foundations is making it easier for businesses to build accurate and effective AI models.</p>

<h3 id="support-for-biology">Support for Biology</h3>

<p>NVIDIA AI Foundations even supports biology as a unique type of LLM, making it the first large-scale AlphaFold API/finetuning service! This is great news for drug discovery and research pipelines.</p>

<p>The ability to use AI to solve complex biological problems has the potential to revolutionize the healthcare industry. By leveraging the power of <a href="https://techwizco.com/10-ways-artificial-intelligence-is-changing-the-world/">AI</a>, researchers can develop new treatments and drugs faster and more effectively than ever before.</p>

<p>This is an important area of focus for NVIDIA AI Foundations because it has the potential to make a real difference in people’s lives. The ability to accelerate the development of new drugs and treatments could mean the difference between life and death for some patients.</p>

<h3 id="enterprise-first-ai-provider">Enterprise-First AI Provider</h3>

<p>With all of these features and benefits, it’s no surprise that 2023 is being called an inflection point for NVIDIA. The company is taking a giant leap forward from being just a hardware provider to becoming an enterprise-first AI provider.</p>

<p>This is an important shift for NVIDIA because it means that the company is taking a more holistic approach to AI. By focusing on the needs of enterprise customers, NVIDIA is better able to provide solutions that are tailored to the unique requirements of businesses.</p>

<p>This shift is also important because it reflects the growing importance of AI in the enterprise landscape. As more and more businesses look to leverage the power of AI to gain a competitive advantage, it’s important for companies like NVIDIA to provide solutions that can meet their needs.</p>

<p>The future of AI is exciting, and NVIDIA AI Foundations is at the forefront of this exciting new era. NVIDIA AI Foundations is well positioned to be a major player in the enterprise AI landscape. It has a Foundation Model as a Service, a multimodal platform, exciting partnerships, and support for biology.</p>

<p>So, what does this mean for businesses? It means that there has never been a better time to start exploring the potential of AI. With NVIDIA AI Foundations, businesses can access powerful AI tools that are tailored to their unique needs.</p>

<p>The ability to build custom AI models using multimodal data means that businesses can solve complex problems in new and innovative ways. This could lead to new products and services, increased efficiency, and improved customer experiences.</p>

<p>The support for biology is particularly exciting because it has the potential to revolutionize the healthcare industry. By using AI to accelerate the development of new treatments and drugs, researchers can make a real difference in people’s lives.</p>

<p>NVIDIA AI Foundations is also making it easier for businesses to access high-quality data sets. This is important because access to high-quality data is essential for building accurate and effective AI models. By partnering with companies that have access to large amounts of data, NVIDIA AI Foundations is making it easier for businesses to build the AI models they need to succeed.</p>

<p>In conclusion, NVIDIA AI Foundations is the future of enterprise AI. With its powerful features and benefits, it’s well positioned to be a major player in the enterprise AI landscape. As more and more businesses look to leverage the power of AI to gain a competitive advantage, NVIDIA AI Foundations is the solution they need. So, if you’re ready to take your business to the next level, I suggest you hop on board the NVIDIA AI Foundations train!</p>]]></content><author><name>john</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Learn how NVIDIA AI Foundations is changing the game in enterprise AI with its tailored Foundation Model as a Service.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://techwizco.com/assets/images/ai-news-nvidia-ai-foundation.svg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://techwizco.com/assets/images/ai-news-nvidia-ai-foundation.svg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">AI Bots: The New Hackers’ Sidekick?</title><link href="https://techwizco.com/news-ai-bots-hackers/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="AI Bots: The New Hackers’ Sidekick?" /><published>2023-03-21T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-03-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://techwizco.com/news-ai-bots-hackers</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://techwizco.com/news-ai-bots-hackers/"><![CDATA[<p>Hey there! Did you hear about this ChatGPT AI bot from OpenAI? People are starting to worry that hackers might use it to attack faster and more effectively. But the real crazy stuff has only happened in labs so far, so no need to panic yet.</p>

<p>This ChatGPT thing is an AI created by <a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a>, a company with a ton of money from Microsoft. What it does is read and generate text, which means it could help hackers write phishing emails that look more legit. Like, if a hacker’s English isn’t great, this AI could make their fake emails way more convincing.</p>

<p>Now, don’t freak out just yet. Dustin Childs, the big cheese of threat awareness at Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative, says ChatGPT is too unpredictable and error-prone to be a reliable weapon right now. He thinks we’re years away from <a href="https://techwizco.com/ethics-of-artificial-intelligence/">AI</a> finding vulnerabilities and exploiting them all on its own. But that won’t always be the case, so we should keep an eye on it.</p>

<p>Two security researchers from Claroty, a cybersecurity company, said ChatGPT actually helped them win the Zero Day Initiative’s hack-a-thon in Miami last month. Noam Moshe, one of the researchers, said this shows how a hacker could use an AI bot like ChatGPT. Generative AI, which makes realistic text or images based on the data they’ve consumed, can help hackers up their game.</p>

<p>At the hack-a-thon called Pwn2Own, the goal was to mess with, break into, and take over the Internet of Things and industrial systems. Participants had to choose targets from a list and prepare tactics beforehand. Moshe and his partner found a few weak spots in the systems they picked, and they used ChatGPT to help write code to link the bugs together, which saved them a ton of time. One bug wouldn’t have done much, but a chain of them could do some damage. They nailed it 10 out of 10 times and won $123,000!</p>

<p>Moshe said, “A vulnerability on its own isn’t interesting, but when we look at the bigger picture and collect vulnerabilities, we can rebuild the chain to take over the system.”</p>

<p>OpenAI and other companies with AI bots like ChatGPT are working on adding controls and filters to prevent abuse, like stopping racist or sexist outputs. But some hackers might still try to get around any security measures the AI bots are taught, said Christopher Whyte, an assistant professor of cybersecurity and homeland security at Virginia Commonwealth University.</p>

<p>Hackers could try to trick the AI bot into writing harmful code by asking it in a sneaky way, without using obvious triggers. Whyte said it’s like when a scammer tricks an office worker into giving away their login info or sending money to fake accounts. “You steer the conversation to get the target to bypass controls,” he explained.</p>

<p>So, what do you think? Are AI bots like ChatGPT gonna be the new sidekick for hackers, or are we safe for now? It’s definitely a conversation worth having, and we should all be aware of what’s happening in the world of AI and cybersecurity. Stay informed, and stay safe out there!</p>]]></content><author><name>andre</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Discover how ChatGPT, an AI bot from OpenAI, could potentially help hackers create more convincing phishing emails and whether it's a real threat yet in this conversational, easy-to-read article.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://techwizco.com/assets/images/ai-news-bots-hackers.svg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://techwizco.com/assets/images/ai-news-bots-hackers.svg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">AI Boss Gets Spooked by His Own Creation: Are We in Trouble?</title><link href="https://techwizco.com/news-ai-boss/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="AI Boss Gets Spooked by His Own Creation: Are We in Trouble?" /><published>2023-03-20T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-03-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://techwizco.com/news-ai-boss</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://techwizco.com/news-ai-boss/"><![CDATA[<p>Hey there! So, have you heard of this AI stuff? You know, <a href="https://techwizco.com/how-to-get-started-with-artificial-intelligence/">artificial intelligence</a>? Yeah, it’s all over the place these days, and the big cheese at OpenAI, Sam Altman, is kinda freaked out by it too. He recently spoke to ABC News and admitted that he’s a “little bit scared” of AI and how it could mess with jobs, elections, and even spread fake news. Yikes!</p>

<p>OpenAI is the company behind ChatGPT, which is like this super-smart robot that can answer questions like a human. It’s all the rage right now, and people are really into it. Sam’s excited about how AI could change the world, but he’s also worried about the not-so-nice folks who might use it for their own twisted purposes.</p>

<p>You see, some governments (the ones who aren’t exactly friendly and open) are working on their own AI tech, and that’s got Sam and the <a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a> team pretty concerned. For instance, Baidu, a Chinese tech company, just launched their own ChatGPT rival called Ernie bot. And if that’s not scary enough, Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, once said that the nation leading in AI would rule the world. That’s some serious James Bond villain vibes right there!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, big tech giants like Google and Microsoft are all in on the AI game, too. Microsoft is actually partnering with OpenAI to use their GPT tech for Bing search, while Google has cooked up its own chatbot, Bard AI. There have been mixed reactions from Google peeps and users, but hey, that’s how it goes with new tech, right?</p>

<p>Now, you might be wondering how all this AI business could affect us. Well, so far, it hasn’t messed with American elections, but Sam’s got his eye on the 2024 race. He’s worried that AI could be used to spread major disinformation and even launch cyberattacks. That’s some scary stuff!</p>

<p>But it’s not all doom and gloom. ChatGPT is already helping developers by acting as a “co-pilot” for programmers, and OpenAI wants to make this kind of helper available for all kinds of jobs. Sure, that might mean some people lose their jobs, but Sam thinks it could also create better ones.</p>

<p>He says that with AI, we could have a higher quality of life and standard of living. Of course, we’ll need time to adjust and get used to this crazy new tech, but hey, that’s just part of the deal when it comes to progress.</p>

<p>So, what do you think? Are we heading for a super-smart AI future, or should we be worried about the possible downsides? Either way, it’s clear that AI is here to stay, and we better buckle up for the ride!</p>

<p>If you want to check out Sam Altman’s full interview, you can find it on <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/openai-ceo-sam-altman-ai-reshape-society-acknowledges/story?id=97897122">ABC News</a>. But for now, let’s keep our fingers crossed that the good guys stay ahead in the AI game and keep the world from turning into some kind of sci-fi dystopia!</p>

<p>But hold on, there’s more to this AI story. You see, some experts are worried that AI might make it super hard to tell what’s real and what’s fake. Imagine a world where you can’t trust anything you read or see online because AI has gotten so good at making stuff up. Talk about a headache!</p>

<p>On the flip side, AI could also be a game-changer when it comes to tackling big problems like climate change and disease. Researchers are already using AI to predict extreme weather events, develop new drugs, and even find ways to suck carbon dioxide out of the air. So, while there are some serious risks to consider, AI could also be our ticket to a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable planet.</p>

<p>And what about all those jobs that might be lost to AI? Well, some people think that AI could actually help create new opportunities and industries. Imagine a world where robots do all the boring, repetitive tasks, leaving us humans free to focus on creative and meaningful work. That sounds pretty sweet, right?</p>

<p>Plus, AI could help level the playing field when it comes to education and healthcare. By making top-notch learning resources and medical advice available to everyone, no matter where they live, AI might just help us build a more equal and just society.</p>

<p>But for all these potential benefits to become a reality, we’ll need to make sure that AI develops in a responsible and ethical way. That means keeping a close eye on how AI is used by governments, businesses, and individuals, and making sure that the technology is used for good, not evil.</p>

<p>Sam Altman and his team at OpenAI are working hard to make sure that AI is developed with the best interests of humanity in mind. They’re committed to making AI safe, transparent, and accessible to everyone. But they can’t do it alone – we all need to be part of the conversation and help shape the future of AI.</p>

<p>So, let’s recap: AI is a powerful technology that’s got some people, including the CEO of OpenAI, feeling a bit nervous. There are legit concerns about job loss, election interference, and the spread of disinformation. But if we can harness AI’s potential for good, we could also enjoy a better quality of life, tackle global challenges, and create new opportunities for everyone.</p>

<p>The AI train is speeding along, and there’s no stopping it now. But by staying informed, engaged, and thoughtful about how we use this technology, we can help make sure that AI brings out the best in us, rather than the worst.</p>

<p>To wrap things up, AI is here to stay, and it’s up to us to decide how we’ll navigate this brave new world. Will we let AI lead us down a dark path, or will we use it as a tool to build a brighter future? The choice is ours, so let’s make it a good one.</p>

<p>So, what do you think? Are you excited about the possibilities AI brings, or are you still a bit spooked like Sam Altman? Let’s keep talking about it and make sure we steer AI in the right direction – for ourselves and future generations.</p>]]></content><author><name>andre</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Discover why OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, is both excited and worried about AI's impact on jobs, elections, and the future, and explore how we can ensure it's used for the greater good.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://techwizco.com/assets/images/news-ai-boss.svg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://techwizco.com/assets/images/news-ai-boss.svg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Essay Typer: The Ultimate Guide to Mastering Your Essay Writing Skills</title><link href="https://techwizco.com/essay-typer/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Essay Typer: The Ultimate Guide to Mastering Your Essay Writing Skills" /><published>2023-03-17T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-03-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://techwizco.com/essay-typer</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://techwizco.com/essay-typer/"><![CDATA[<p>Hey there, fellow students and aspiring writers!

Big companies like Microsoft and Google are working super hard to make their AI tools even better. But there’s one famous name that’s been super quiet about it all: <a href="https://apple.com">Apple</a>. Sure, the Silicon Valley Bank collapse has been in the news a lot, but AI is still a hot topic.</p>

<p>Just last month, Apple had a secret meeting all about AI and huge language models. The New York Times said that tons of teams, even the ones working on Siri, are trying out new ways to make language with AI. Plus, 9to5Mac spilled the beans about Apple making something called “Siri Natural Language Generation” for tvOS 16.4.</p>

<p>For a long time, Siri hasn’t been great at understanding what people are saying (trust me, I’ve had trouble too). Siri and other helpers like Alexa and Google Assistant have had a tough time getting different accents and pronunciations right, even if everyone’s speaking the same language. But now, with cool stuff like ChatGPT and text-based search, it’s way easier to talk to AI. The only problem is, right now, you have to turn on a special setting to chat with Siri.</p>

<p>John Burke, who used to work at Apple on Siri, told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/">The New York Times</a> that Siri hasn’t gotten much better because of some messy code. That means it’s super hard to add even simple updates. He also said that Siri has a ginormous pile of words, so when they want to add new stuff, they have to rebuild the whole thing, which can take up to six weeks. Yikes!</p>

<p>The New York Times didn’t say if Apple is making its own language models or if they’re going to use one that’s already out there. But just like Google and Microsoft, Apple probably doesn’t want to be stuck with just a Siri chatbot. Apple has always been super supportive of artists and creative people, so they’d probably want to use language models to help those folks too.</p>

<p>Apple has actually been using AI for a while now, even if you don’t notice it right away. They’ve got better suggestions on the keyboard, smarter photo processing, unlocking with Face ID while wearing a mask, and even separating things from their background in pictures. They also have handwashing and crash detection on the Apple Watch, and they recently added a karaoke feature to Apple Music. These things might not be as in-your-face as chatbots, but they show that Apple knows what they’re doing with AI.</p>

<p>In January, Apple started a program where they help authors turn their books into audiobooks using AI-powered voices. This means that Apple is already thinking about how to use AI to make new stuff. I wouldn’t be shocked if we hear more about what Apple is doing with AI at the Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) in a few months.</p>

<p>So, with everyone in the tech world talking non-stop about AI and chatbots, we’re all wondering what Apple is going to do to keep up with everyone else. Will Siri make a big comeback? We’ll have to wait and see, but one thing’s for sure: Apple is just getting started with <a href="https://techwizco.com/text-to-speech-mp3/">AI</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name>john</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Discover how Apple's hush-hush AI adventures might help them catch up with the chatbot craze, as we explore their secret projects, Siri's struggles, and what the future might hold!]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://techwizco.com/assets/images/ai-news-apple-ai.svg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://techwizco.com/assets/images/ai-news-apple-ai.svg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">OpenAI Unveils GPT-4: A New Milestone in Multimodal Deep Learning and AI Performance</title><link href="https://techwizco.com/news-openai-unveils-gpt-4/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="OpenAI Unveils GPT-4: A New Milestone in Multimodal Deep Learning and AI Performance" /><published>2023-03-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-03-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://techwizco.com/news-openai-unveils-gpt-4</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://techwizco.com/news-openai-unveils-gpt-4/"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a> has achieved a significant milestone with the creation of GPT-4, the latest development in their ongoing efforts to scale up deep learning. GPT-4 is a large multimodal model capable of accepting both image and text inputs, and generating text outputs.</p>

<p>While it may not yet surpass human capabilities in every real-world scenario, it does demonstrate human-level performance on a wide range of professional and academic benchmarks. For instance, GPT-4 can pass a simulated bar exam with a score ranking among the top 10% of test-takers, a notable improvement over its predecessor, GPT-3.5, which scored around the bottom 10%.</p>

<p>Over the course of six months, OpenAI has worked diligently to iteratively align GPT-4 using insights from their adversarial testing program, as well as from ChatGPT. This has resulted in their best-ever outcomes in terms of factuality, steerability, and adherence to imposed guardrails, although there is still room for improvement.</p>

<p>In the past two years, OpenAI has completely re-engineered their deep learning stack. They have also collaborated closely with Azure to design a supercomputer specifically tailored to their workload. About a year ago, GPT-3.5 was trained as an initial “test run” of the system.</p>

<p>This exercise allowed them to identify and address bugs while refining their theoretical foundations. Consequently, the GPT-4 training run proved to be remarkably stable, marking the first instance where OpenAI could accurately predict a large model’s training performance in advance. As the organization continues to prioritize reliable scaling, they aspire to refine their methodology, enabling them to predict and prepare for future capabilities well in advance—a critical aspect for ensuring safety.</p>

<p>OpenAI is launching GPT-4’s text input capabilities through ChatGPT and the API (with a waitlist). To make the image input functionality more widely accessible, they are initially collaborating with a single partner. Furthermore, OpenAI is open-sourcing their framework for automated evaluation of AI model performance, called OpenAI Evals. This will enable anyone to report shortcomings in their models, thereby guiding further enhancements.</p>

<p>GPT-4 serves as a testament to the impressive advancements made by OpenAI in the realm of deep learning. By refining and expanding upon earlier models like GPT-3.5, the organization has successfully developed a more capable and reliable multimodal model that can handle both text and image inputs. The ongoing pursuit of improvements in factuality, steerability, and adherence to guardrails demonstrates OpenAI’s commitment to creating AI technologies that are both powerful and safe for use.</p>

<p>Collaboration has been a crucial component of OpenAI’s success, as evidenced by their close partnership with Azure in the development of a purpose-built supercomputer. Moreover, their open-source approach to sharing evaluation frameworks, such as OpenAI Evals, underscores their dedication to involving the wider AI community in the ongoing quest for improvement.</p>

<p>As OpenAI continues to forge ahead in the development of ever more advanced AI models like GPT-4, it is clear that they are making significant strides toward achieving their goal of reliable scaling. By maintaining a strong focus on safety and fostering collaboration with partners and the broader AI community, OpenAI is well-positioned to make even greater leaps in the future of deep learning technology.</p>]]></content><author><name>andre</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Discover GPT-4, OpenAI's groundbreaking multimodal deep learning model, and learn how it's shaping the future of AI technology and real-world applications.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://techwizco.com/assets/images/ai-news-gpt-4-interface.svg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://techwizco.com/assets/images/ai-news-gpt-4-interface.svg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Text to Speech MP3: Unlocking the Power of the Spoken Word</title><link href="https://techwizco.com/text-to-speech-mp3/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Text to Speech MP3: Unlocking the Power of the Spoken Word" /><published>2023-03-15T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-03-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://techwizco.com/text-to-speech-mp3</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://techwizco.com/text-to-speech-mp3/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="text-to-speech-mp3">Text to Speech MP3</h2>

According to sources close to the project, the virtual personal assistant will provide drivers with a voice-activated chatbot that will use Microsoft’s Azure cloud service to enhance their driving experience.</p>

<h2 id="ai-assistant">AI Assistant</h2>

<p>GM’s vice president of software defined vehicle and operating system, Scott Miller, has confirmed that the company is developing an AI assistant that could offer more than the simple voice commands that are currently available in today’s cars. The AI assistant will utilize transformer models, a breakthrough in artificial intelligence technology capable of learning from exponentially larger pools of data, allowing it to expand its capabilities beyond what was once thought possible.</p>

<h2 id="natural-language-technology">Natural Language Technology</h2>

<p>The AI assistant will be able to answer questions such as how to change a flat tire or what a diagnostic light on the dashboard means. It can even make an appointment at a recommended repair shop, creating a seamless driving experience that is safe and efficient. With the <a href="https://techwizco.com/ai-story-generator/">natural language technology</a> used by ChatGPT, drivers can converse with their vehicles like never before.</p>

<h2 id="car-specific-open-ai-model">Car Specific Open AI model</h2>

<p>GM’s two-year-old partnership with Microsoft on autonomous vehicles has provided them with a head start on incorporating this new technology into their vehicles. However, the version of AI assistant in GM cars will behave differently than ChatGPT or Bing Chat as it will have another, more car-specific layer on top of the OpenAI models. This layer will help ensure the AI assistant can respond to the unique needs of drivers.</p>

<p>One of the main challenges automakers have faced in creating a voice-activated interface for drivers is the lack of natural language technology capable of making them useful. This technology has now caught up with the demands of the automotive industry thanks to the breakthroughs in transformer models, which have opened up new possibilities for AI assistants.</p>

<h2 id="smartphones-competition">SmartPhones Competition</h2>

<p>Despite GM’s progress, automakers’ AI still face competition from mobile phones, which are both valuable and dangerous parts of contemporary driving in the United States, where distracted driving causes around 3,500 deaths a year. Tech giants such as Google, Apple, and Amazon have made efforts to improve the situation by integrating their phones with auto companies, but GM and other automakers are reluctant to rely solely on smartphones. They aim to create a new array of possibilities by bypassing smartphones and integrating directly with consumers’ favorite software, such as Spotify and Whole Foods.</p>

<h2 id="car-companies-transformation-into-tech-companies">Car Companies Transformation Into Tech Companies</h2>

<p>The transformation of car companies into tech companies is already well underway, as nearly every vehicle component depends in part on software. However, the challenge lies in pulling all those pieces together into one operating system. As car companies progress, some will inevitably do this better than others. They may even choose to license their technology to competitors, allowing them to take advantage of the new possibilities provided by artificial intelligence.</p>

<h2 id="voice-activated-chatbot-assistant">Voice-Activated Chatbot Assistant</h2>

<p>In conclusion, GM’s new AI assistant powered by ChatGPT is set to revolutionize the driving experience by providing drivers with a voice-activated chatbot that can assist with everything from changing a flat tire to scheduling a repair appointment. This breakthrough in artificial intelligence technology is a significant step towards a future where cars and their drivers can converse seamlessly, making driving safer, more efficient, and ultimately more enjoyable.</p>]]></content><author><name>john</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Get ready for a groundbreaking driving experience with General Motors' latest innovation: an AI assistant powered by ChatGPT.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://techwizco.com/assets/images/ai-news-car-01.svg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://techwizco.com/assets/images/ai-news-car-01.svg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
