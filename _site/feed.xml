<h1 id="artificial-intelligence-transparency">Artificial Intelligence Transparency</h1>

<p>AI transparency is how much you can see and understand about how artificial intelligence (AI) systems and algorithms work on the inside. In other words, it is the ability to explain how an AI system arrived at a specific decision or outcome. The importance of AI transparency comes from the fact that AI is being used in more and more important and sensitive areas, such as finance, healthcare, and justice, where transparency is essential to ensure accountability and build trust.</p>

<p>Lack of transparency in AI is a significant concern for several reasons. First, it can make it hard to hold people accountable and understand how intelligent systems make decisions. This is especially important in sensitive areas like the justice system, where an AI system might be used to make decisions that can have a big effect on a person’s life, like jail time or parole. If the decision-making process behind such AI systems is not transparent, it becomes difficult to understand the factors that went into making a particular decision, and how biases might have influenced the outcome.</p>

<p>Second, the problem of AI bias is closely linked to the fact that AI systems are not very clear. AI algorithms and models can reinforce biases that are already there, like those found in training data, which can lead to biased decision-making. Because AI algorithms and models aren’t always clear, it can be hard to find and fix biases. This means that harmful biases could go unchecked and keep spreading in society.</p>

<p>Lastly, AI transparency is also closely linked to ethics and the right way to use AI. AI algorithms could affect human rights like privacy and freedom of speech, and the lack of transparency in AI raises questions about who is responsible for the results of intelligent systems and how they should be held accountable. In light of these concerns, there is an increasing need for AI transparency, especially in areas where AI systems are being used to make critical decisions that can have significant consequences for individuals and society.</p>

<p>In the end, AI transparency is an important part of AI governance and using AI in a responsible way. Making AI systems and algorithms as clear as possible can help build trust in AI, increase accountability, and reduce the chance of bias and unethical behavior. Governments and organizations must prioritize transparency in AI development, deployment, and use, and work towards creating ethical and responsible AI structures that are transparent, accountable, and aligned with ethical values and principles.</p>

<h3 id="generative-adversarial-networks-gans">Generative adversarial networks (GANs)</h3>

<p>Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that is used to generate synthetic data, such as images or audio. They work by training two neural networks against each other, with one network generating synthetic data and the other network trying to identify whether the data is real or synthetic.</p>

<p>The process begins with the “generator” network, which is trained to produce synthetic data that is similar to a given dataset. The synthetic data is then passed to the “discriminator” network, which is trained to identify whether the data is real or synthetic. The discriminator network provides feedback to the generator network, which is used to improve the quality of the synthetic data.</p>

<p>This process continues until the generator network is able to produce synthetic data that is indistinguishable from real data. The resulting synthetic data can be used for a variety of purposes, such as data augmentation, testing machine learning models, or creating new content.</p>

<p>GANs have been used in a number of applications, including the generation of realistic images, video, and audio. They have also been used to generate synthetic data for a variety of other purposes, such as weather forecasting and drug discovery.</p>

<p>Widgets are a simple and appealing way to display useful information on your home screen. What’s the best part? They may be stacked together to form what Apple refers to as a Smart Stack, which includes built-in apps! One of my favorite examples is how they’ve designed it so you don’t have to check the widget box every single day - instead, these dynamic pieces alter themselves based upon whatever crucial material might crop up that morning (like meetings).</p>

<p>Your iPhone 13 is much more helpful with the new widgets. Third-party app developers have been granted a year by Apple to create their own interactive mobile apps and add them as configurable shortcuts on top of built-in ones like Caller ID or Camera app!</p>

<h3 id="safari-tab-bar-adjustment">Safari Tab Bar Adjustment</h3>

<p>When iOS 15 was released, many people weren’t aware that Apple had moved the tab bar from its traditional position at the top right of the web page down below. This made Safari more convenient for one-handed use on larger iPhones because you can now easily reach with your thumb rather than having to move up and down between different screens like before! It is particularly useful on larger phones like iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro, and iPhone 13 Pro Max.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/iphone-safari-tab-bar-01.avif" alt="safari tab bar" /> <br />

  <li>Warm: Golden undertones create a warmer look.</li>
  <li>Cool: Blue undertones create a cooler look.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also customize the effects of the styles by adjusting their color and warmth.</p>

<h3 id="cinematic-mode">Cinematic Mode</h3>

<p>With the new Cinematic Mode and extra cameras on the iPhone 13 series pro models, you can now create Hollywood-style videos. When you enable this function, your footage has a depth of field and automatically focuses based on what’s happening in the video - so if someone turns towards another person for a chat, they’ll become clearer than before!</p>

<p>Cinematic Setting, among other photographic styles, is a new, dedicated mode in the camera app for the iPhone 13. It is accessible alongside Video and Portrait shots while recording video! The focus will now move to whatever you tap on - thus if your video topic isn’t crisp enough, for example, simply pressing again will remedy that problem without requiring any extra video edits from you by using this useful apple tool.</p>

<h3 id="notifications">Notifications</h3>

<p>Notifications in iOS 15 are significantly more orderly and properly classified. Notifications can now be grouped by service, app, or person, which was not possible prior to iOS 15. The new notification options in iOS 15 are more customizable than ever! You may now specify which applications send them notifications and when they wish to be notified.</p>

<p>Furthermore, with the ability to disable system-wide or individual Focus, you can regulate how much information distractions bring into your life—ideal if there’s anything specific going on right now that requires attention but shouldn’t take over everything else.</p>

<p>But who has time to look through hundreds of notifications every day if you’re a busy person? Notification summaries are here to keep your information private! Instead of being bombarded with alerts throughout the day from low-priority sources like Facebook or emails about what’s going on in politics right now (which may or may not be of interest to us), we can now choose how many messages make up each summary; when they appear at specific times throughout the day—and whether or not we want these updates delivered straight to our phones without any additional intervention required.</p>

<h3 id="visual-look-up">Visual Look Up</h3>

<p>iOS 15 for iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro, and iPhone 13 Pro Max brought new smart camera functions - Visual Look Up and Live Text.</p>

Simply swipe up on an image in any program that displays digital photographs, such as the iBooks Store or Mail App. You’ll get information about where it was taken and what’s going down right now — even if they’re plants…or animals. Don’t worry, this also works when browsing messages and websites accessed via links within such apps.</p>

<p>Another very useful iOS 15 feature that works on iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro, and iPhone 13 Pro Max is Live Text. It is a life saver if you need to copy a large portion of text from a screenshot or a picture and have to type it all manually.</p>

<p>Apart from being able to read a qr code, Live Text lets you copy any text from your pictures or even from your camera and paste this text into a text field of any app that permits this action.</p>

<p>The good news is Live text can recognize typed and handwritten text details and understands several foreign languages including Chinese, Spanish, and German. This option also works in the Safari browser and in any app that you can use to type in. In those apps, you can use a Scan Text option.</p>

<p>When you click on Scan Text the phone camera will be activated and you’ll be able to scan all text details right into your message.</p>

<h3 id="do-the-iphone-13-phones-have-chargers-in-the-box">Do the iPhone 13 phones have chargers in the box?</h3>

<p>No chargers are included with any of the iPhone 13 series, however, they all support wireless charging.</p>

Because of the benefits, businesses are migrating from other hosts to Convesio. In this section, we will discuss why your organization should consider using Convesio for WordPress hosting and what benefits you may expect.</p>

<h2 id="what-convesio-next-generation-wordpress-hosting-is-about">What Convesio next generation WordPress hosting is about?</h2>

<p>Convesio, being a cloud-based hosting platform, offers WordPress users the most up-to-date web technology. In contrast to typical solutions, Convesio’s multi-tenant environment allows each website on their system to be backed up by redundant data storage clusters, as well as having offshore backup options for those who desire it! You can also improve the performance of your sites by substantially scaling PHP run time and, if necessary, using auto-healing architecture solutions.</p>

<p>WordPress hosting at its finest Convesio is a platform that combines open source software and proprietary code to solve a single problem: operating WordPress in large-scale environments. The solution includes built-in features such as Cloudflare Enterprise, which improves performance while delivering an extra layer of security to your website before requests even reach the servers!</p>

<p>Convesio is a hybrid cloud solution that handles your WordPress demands by overcoming the problems associated with hosting it on scalable environments. With high availability and elastic scalability in mind, it has been deployed across Google Cloud, AWS, and Steadfast platforms.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-managed-wordpress-hosting">What is managed WordPress hosting?</h2>

<p>Managed WordPress hosting is a dedicated environment intended for speed, high availability, scalability, and security when just running WordPress.</p>

<p>Managed WordPress hosting simply implies that you are not responsible for any underlying infrastructure, such as web server updates, backups, security checks, and so on. It is typically faster, more secure, and contains extra services such as automatic backups.</p>

<p>Because Convesio managed WordPress hosting includes load balancers, a cache layer, built-in edge caching, HTTP/2, and CDN technologies, your website will load significantly faster than on standard shared hosting.</p>

<p>Convesio is a proprietary design that allows your site (and hence all of its contents) to scale automatically if you need to handle high volumes of traffic. The system runs in several containers on multiple servers to handle any demand - even an unexpected surge!</p>

<h2 id="benefits-of-using-best-wordpress-hosting-convesio">Benefits Of Using Best WordPress Hosting Convesio</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>High Avalability</strong> Convesio’s powerful load-balancer containers ensure that your site is always available. As a result, you can be confident that yours will always be up and running, even during peak hours when other websites may encounter downtime!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Horizontal Autoscaling</strong> - When the number of visitors to your website increases, Convesio’s auto-scaling mechanism automatically expands the server farm with more virtual servers. This saves you money because you won’t need a system administrator for this work, and it also improves performance because resources are controlled dynamically instead!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>WordPress speed optimization</strong> - Let’s face it, your website needs to be fast, dependable, and simple for customers/clients (and potential ones!) to navigate; but most importantly, they want the site load times on their devices or browsers to be low enough so things feel snappy with no lag at all! Convesio WordPress hosting analyzes how much capacity YOU require with our free performance optimization analysis…we’ll even show you where areas could benefit from some modifications so you don’t have to worry about having additional hardware later on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>MySQL DB Cluster</strong> - Convesio WordPress hosting includes a strong MySQL server cluster that eliminates a single point of failure. This means you may expect rapid and efficient responses when processing information requests from viewers or customers!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Page Caching</strong> Convesio’s cache is entirely custom-built and designed from the ground up for WordPress. Because the platform is entirely made up of novel features, no WordPress plugins are necessary! With con successive layers such as time to live settings or exception rules, you can control page level storage on your website to ensure that all data remains fresh even if someone returns later without having previously visited it - this way, their visit will be faster due to less reloading/refreshing required at each step through pages while they browse around.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Automated backups</strong> - With a single click, you can configure advanced backup and retention settings, including how frequently backups should be performed and how long each kind should be stored. Backup periods can range from 24 hours to 180 days - that’s a lot more control than most people realize! You can also utilize your backup to set up a staging WordPress site.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Application Monitoring</strong> - Development teams can utilize Convesio to collect application performance monitoring (APM) log data to ensure the seamless delivery of their online apps. Developers can check an app’s availability, problems it may have introduced into your site, or other things that may have a negative impact on end-user experience; you will be notified before any changes go live.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>WordPress Self Recovery</strong> - If you want an easy solution to shield yourself from the risks of restoring a web hosting database, go no further than Convesio’s self-restoration data option. It keeps backups of all your crucial data and restores them automatically if something goes wrong.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Complex Migrations</strong> - Because some of the more complex WordPress installations cannot be converted with a simple plugin, Convesio provides manual migration to assure proper functioning, minimal downtime, and data integrity.</p>
  </li>

Having said that, Convesio engineers are always willing to assist when needed!</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-docker-platform-and-why-does-it-matter">What is a Docker Platform and why does it matter</h2>

<p>This is why it’s so crucial to have a few different servers for your websites. If one goes down or becomes overburdened, you may still give outstanding service by switching over all the sites on that particular machine rather than losing patience with waiting periods while trying other solutions such as relocating their domain name!</p>

<p>A typical but easily avoidable issue is server failure, which can occur when every single website created under one administrative account is hosted at the same physical location, resulting in hundreds, if not thousands, of calls seeking immediate response.</p>

<p>Convesio has discovered a solution to the problem of site hosting by utilizing Docker containers. With no downtime, this innovative technology will give you more room on your server, faster speeds, and better security than ever before.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Docker is a software platform that allows you to package and run your applications in containers on the same operating system as their hosts. The primary distinction between this strategy and standard virtual machines is found in two factors: The overhead associated with managing different instances is frequently not worth it; isolation—because everything operates inside one cohesive unit, there are no security issues associated with merely running several workloads concurrently.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You may have an up-to-date website in seconds with container services. This is accomplished by software virtualization, which enables the service to run numerous apps concurrently on a single server without slowing down or crashing any of them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Convesio’s hosting solution is more useful than other virtual server providers because of its versatility. You can host an unlimited number of websites on the autoscaling Docker environment with a single account.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Container technology transforms websites by eliminating the danger of website failure and making traffic balancing easier. Docker containers, because they are built on several servers, are an ideal approach to ensure that your website and data are safe in the event of a disaster.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Convesio provides numerous containers for each customer that may be automatically scaled up or down in response to traffic levels. These quick-scaling, simple management capabilities assist you in meeting your high availability and scalability requirements!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

It does not support any other content management systems or code outside of the framework, which is why the service was designed to make installing pluggable themes on the Convesio minimalist environment as simple as possible.</p>

For its infrastructure Covesio currently uses Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform-Powered Enterprise Edition(GCP PE) &amp; Steadfast Systems’ proprietary offering.</p>

<p><strong>5. What are the geographical locations of Convesio servers?</strong></p>

<p>Currently, Convesio clusters are implemented in North America, Europe, and Australia.</p>

<p><strong>6. How is Convesio container usage different from other hosting providers?</strong></p>

<p>Here is an explanation <a href="https://convesio.com/faq/">from Convesio</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Other popular providers do take advantage of containers, but in a very different way than Convesio. Effectively they are using containers as the next generation VPS. All the components of your site run inside a single scalable container. This creates an environment similar to a traditional VPS with all the normal Single Points of Failure associated with WordPress. We have a container based architecture that is scalable at several different layers. For instance, your WordPress runtime, which is just your PHP Instance, can scale separately from your DB Instance and our Load Balancers.</p>

This how-to guide will help you through the process of setting up your own own Plex server.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-beast-plex-server">What is a Beast Plex Server?</h3>

<p>All your video, audio, and other visual information is stored, organized, and streamed by the Plex Media Server. Server clients are playback apps that can be installed on a wide range of devices and web browsers.</p>

<p>Plex Media Server is the name of the back-end component, which is free (you do not need to subscribe to a Plex pass account to use it). It can receive content from files, iTunes, iPhoto, Aperture, or the internet and then organize it into a library based on metadata tags like title, artist, album, genre, year, and popularity.</p>

<p>It organizes audio and video content from personal media libraries and streams it to the player, either locally or over a LAN, depending on the user’s preference. Plex works with a variety of operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and FreeBSD, as well as NAS and the Nvidia Shield TV.</p>

<p>The player apps utilized on the front end include Plex Web App, Plexamp, and Plex Dash. They let the user to manage and play any and all content saved on the Plex Media Server. The great majority of apps are free to download.</p>

<p>Users with free Plex accounts can access Plex, Inc.’s content collection, which includes ad-supported video on demand and free-to-stream live TV channels. These free accounts also enable users to share their personal media libraries with friends or among their own device collection.</p>

<h3 id="plex-media-server-hardware-requirements">Plex Media Server hardware requirements</h3>

<p>It is critical to adhere to the Plex hardware specifications while building your own beast plex server. Your beast plex server can be run on a desktop computer, server hardware, or a NAS storage device such as Drobo, Netgear, or Synology. A complete Plex NAS compatibility guide <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MfYoJkiwSqCXg8cm5-Ac4oOLPRtCkgUxU0jdj3tmMPc/edit#gid=1274624273">may be found here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="beast-plex-servers-cpu-requirements">Beast Plex Servers CPU requirements</h3>

<p>The minimum CPU requirements for Plex servers are Intel Core i3, but this is dependent on how many people are accessing content at the same time. Because the server may need transcoding of content during playback at times, you may require something quicker than the minimum.</p>

<p>If your computer’s CPU cannot keep up with transcoding your media, you will notice halting or buffering while the app waits for the server to catch up.</p>

<p>The most important thing to remember is that the more Plex programs that are playing content at the same time, the more processing power is required. When you have two Plex apps operating at the same time, each of which requires transcoded content, the amount of processing power required by your computer’s central processing unit (CPU) nearly doubles when only one program is playing video.</p>

<p>Flex suggests the following CPU specs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>No transcoding: “Atom” 1.2GHz (NAS based on ARM processors)</li>
  <li>Single 720p transcode: Intel i3 3.0 GHz</li>
  <li>Single 1080p transcode: Intel Core i5 3.0GHz</li>
  <li>Single 4K transcode: Intel Core i7 3.2GHz</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="beast-plex-server-memory-requirements">Beast Plex Server memory requirements</h3>

<p>In most cases, Plex Media Server does not need a significant amount of memory (RAM) to provide the service. In most cases, 2 gigabytes of memory is more than adequate. Some installations, particularly those based on Linux, can often run without even that much memory. Having more RAM won’t hurt you in any way, and it will definitely be helpful if you’re using the computer for a variety of tasks at the same time.</p>

<h3 id="is-it-a-good-idea-to-build-your-own-beast-plex-server-on-a-nas">Is it a good idea to build your own beast plex server on a NAS?</h3>

<p>Plex Media Server operating on a network attached storage (NAS) device may be an ideal alternative for some users, but it is not always appropriate for all situations.</p>

<p>The fact that most consumer NAS do not have particularly powerful CPUs is going to be the most aggravating limitation for most customers. In other cases, the mobile device will be powered by an ARM-based processor that lacks any capacity or capabilities for content transcoding.</p>

<p>On other cases, it may run on an Intel processor that is theoretically capable of transcoding but is too slow to transcode at a rate adequate for the majority of applications.</p>

<p>If you want to run your beast plex server on a NAS, you may read a pretty extensive <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/201373793-is-plex-media-server-on-a-nas-right-for-me/">article here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-install-and-build-your-own-beast-plex-server">How to install and build your own beast plex server</h3>

<p>Plex installation is comparable to other software installations, with the exception that you must first install the server software. Once this is completed, you can begin using Plex. Following that, you must install programs on each of your devices in order for them to connect to the server.</p>

<p>Organizing your numerous sources of media is a potentially critical step. As you set up your Plex Material Server, you will begin the process of establishing libraries for your media, such as movies, television shows, music, photographs, and home videos.</p>

<p>Plex will recognize and match material like as movies and TV shows when you do this. It will then collect information such as movie poster artwork, movie casts, and TV episode descriptions, among other things, to beautify your collections.</p>

<h4 id="choosing-a-server-and-performance-considerations">Choosing a server and performance considerations</h4>

<p>Plex Media Server is compatible with computers running Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux; some users run it on their primary computer, while others deploy it on a separate machine. It is also possible to install it on a NAS, provided that it is compatible. In general, Plex runs without any issues on the majority of modern computers.</p>

<p>Keep in mind two important points for providing a good plex media server performance.</p>

<h4 id="media-users">Media Users</h4>

<p>To begin, the Plex Media Server may broadcast material to several users’ devices at the same time. Assume that everyone in your family is watching a film or other sort of media on Plex at the same time, which consumes more server resources. As a result, the server’s power must be increased in proportion to the number of individuals viewing material at the same time.</p>

<h4 id="bandwidth">Bandwidth</h4>

<p>Second, when Plex optimizes your media files for specific devices or available bandwidth, it converts (or “transcodes”) the content while it is playing. This needs a tremendous amount of server resources, but it allows you to access all of your stuff, regardless of size, on all of your devices, regardless of size.</p>

<p>Problems with playback, such as stuttering, buffering, or even failure to play at all, indicate that your server lacks the processing power required for the manner you utilize it.</p>

<p>When this happens, it almost always means that the central processing unit (CPU) is struggling to keep up with the number of users, the amount of transcoding, or both. As a result, you should seriously consider updating your gear. It’s also possible that your hardware is fine, but your connection’s speed is the issue.</p>

<h4 id="download-your-beast-plex-server">Download your beast plex server</h4>

<p>Once you’ve selected where you’ll install the Plex Media Server, go to the <a href="https://plex.tv/downloads/">Plex Downloads website</a> and download the server for your device from there. Make sure you select the correct plex server software for your operating system.</p>

<p>It is critical to ensure that the computer acting as the server has an active internet connection during the installation procedure. The setup wizard will then work properly, and you will be able to create an account as it does so.</p>

<h4 id="download-a-plex-player-app">Download a Plex Player App</h4>

<p>While you’re on the Downloads page, you might wish to install a player app for your device. The browser-based Plex Web App is provided with the server; however, to use it on other devices, you will most likely need to download an app.</p>

<p>The beast plex server apps are available for desktops running Windows and Mac OS, mobile devices running Android and iOS, and connected devices such as Amazon Fire TV, Android TV, Roku, Smart TVs, gaming consoles, and so on.</p>

<h3 id="you-beast-plex-server-installation">You beast plex server installation</h3>

<p>The server is compatible with a wide range of operating systems and platforms. Installation is always performed using an installation package and follows the platform’s regular installation method. When working with NAS, it is critical to follow the manufacturer’s add-on installation instructions.</p>

<h4 id="beast-plex-server-on-windows">Beast Plex Server on Windows</h4>

<p>Download the installer file with an.exe file extension to install your beast plex server on Windows 10 or Windows 11.</p>

<p>Run the installer and proceed with the standard Windows 10 installation procedure. After the installation is complete, click the “Launch” button or use the Start button to launch the Beast plex server.</p>

<p>It is time to perform a beast plex software initial configuration when the server has been activated and displays a System Tray icon (the one at the bottom right of the screen). Simply select “Open Plex…” from the Plex system tray menu.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/beast-plex-servre-initial-configuration.avif" alt="Best Plex Server on Windows" /></p>

<h4 id="beast-plex-server-on-mac-os">Beast Plex Server on Mac OS</h4>

<p>To build your own beast plex server on Mac OS, download the Plex Media Server software .zip file, unzip the file, and drag the beast plex app to your Mac Applications folder.</p>

<p>After launching the media server from the Application folder, you can begin initial server setup by clicking on “Open Plex…” from the “&gt;” icon.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/beast-plex-server-initial-setup-on-mac.avif" alt="Beast Plex Server on Mac" />Source plex.tv</p>

<h4 id="beast-plex-server-on-linux">Beast Plex Server on Linux</h4>

<p>To install the Beast Plex server on Fedora/CentOS download the .rpm package with a current version and run “sudo yum install plexmediaserver-x.xx.x.xxxx.x86_64.rpm”. To proceed with the initial server setup, open a browser on the same server and go to http://localhost:32400/web.</p>

<p>To install Beast server on Ubuntu, download the .deb package and run “sudo dpkg -i plexmediaserver-x.xx.x.xxxx.x86_64.deb”. To set up the server, go to the same URL as shown above for the Fedora installation.</p>

<p>By default, the Beast Media Server runs in the context of the user “plex.” Your media directories and files must allow the plex user to read and execute files in order for plex to work properly.</p>

<h4 id="your-beast-server-on-a-network-attached-storage">Your Beast server on a Network Attached Storage</h4>

<p>Download the installation package for your particular NAS and follow your hardware specific installation instructions to install the server. Go to http://nas.ip.address:32400/web address to configure your server.</p>

<h3 id="to-open-the-streaming-web-app-on-a-different-computer">To open the streaming web app on a different computer</h3>

<h4 id="on-the-same-local-network">On the same local network</h4>

<p>If your other computer is on the same local network as your server, you can simply open a browser window, go to the following address, http://local.server.ip.address:32400/web, and you will be connected to the server.</p>

<h4 id="on-a-different-network">On a different network</h4>

<p>If your client is remote on a different network, you have to go through a slightly more complicated procedure of setting up an SSH tunnel to initially configure your server.</p>

<h5 id="ssh-tunnel-on-mac-os-or-linux">SSH tunnel on Mac OS or Linux</h5>

<p>You are going to use a command line on the terminal to configure the tunnel. So, open your terminal and enter the following command: “ssh -L 8888:127.0.0.1:32400 your.server.ip.address”. Now, in your browser, open the following address “http://127.0.0.1:8888/web” and you will be connected to the server.</p>

<h5 id="ssh-tunnel-on-windows">SSH tunnel on Windows</h5>

<p>If your client and the server both use Windows, they support RDP protocol features, and you can connect using a Remote Desktop session.</p>

<p>However, if your server is based on Mac OS or Linux, you would need to use either the built-in SSH client that support SSH tunneling or a Putty application to configure the tunnel. For Putty connection you have to specify a gateway, which is your.server.ip.address, source port 8888, and your destination 127.0.0.1:32400. After everything is set, you can reach your server via your browser at the address http://127.0.0.1:8888/web.</p>

<h3 id="your-media-collection">Your Media Collection</h3>

<p>Finally, properly structuring your media collection is the most crucial step in offering exceptional multimedia server capabilities.</p>

<p>Your media should have a specified file structure that is distinct for media in their own directories, stand-alone media files, and numerous editions in order for the media server to perform properly.</p>

<p>Please see the <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/categories/your-media/">Plex full media organization tutorial</a> for help with naming and arranging your music, TV show, and personal media files, as well as employing subtitles.</p>

<h3 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion</h3>

<p>Adding a Beast Plex server to your home network is a great way to increase the storage capacity of your personal media library while also making streaming content easier than ever.</p>

<p>If you use the official Beast Plex application, you will not have access to additional capabilities such as transcoding and background playback. However, if you build your own Beast Plex server, you will be able to tailor it to match your needs while adhering to any constraints you may have.</p>]]></content><author><name>andre</name></author><category term="How To" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Build Your Own Beast Plex Server to run your own streaming video services.
