You know, the ones like ChatGPT that have been causing quite a stir lately. He mentioned that we’ll need to come up with new ideas instead of just making these models bigger and bigger.</p>

<p>OpenAI has been doing some amazing stuff with AI that works with language, like GPT-4, which was probably trained using trillions of words of text and thousands of computer chips. This whole thing cost over $100 million. But Sam Altman believes that making models even larger isn’t going to cut it anymore.</p>

<p>It’s kinda surprising, especially since Microsoft used ChatGPT’s technology to add a chatbot to Bing, and Google launched its own chatbot called Bard. Plus, a bunch of well-funded startups are throwing tons of resources at building massive algorithms to catch up with OpenAI.</p>

<p>So, it seems like GPT-4 might be the last big advance to come from OpenAI’s strategy of making models bigger and feeding them more data. Nobody knows yet what kind of research strategies or techniques might replace it. Even Altman says there are physical limits to how many data centers they can build and how fast they can do it.</p>

<p>Nick Frosst, a guy who cofounded Cohere and used to work on AI at Google, agrees with Altman that just going bigger won’t work forever. He thinks there are other ways of improving transformers, like new AI model designs or fine-tuning based on human feedback. A lot of researchers are already looking into this.</p>

<p>A quick recap: OpenAI’s language algorithms are made up of artificial neural networks, which are trained to predict the words that should follow a given string of text. The first model, GPT-2, had 1.5 billion parameters, and GPT-3 had a mind-blowing 175 billion. This led other companies and research institutions to build their own huge AI models.</p>

<p>People were thinking that GPT-4 would be even more massive, but when it was finally announced, OpenAI didn’t even mention how big it is. Maybe because size isn’t everything? Sam Altman admitted that training GPT-4 cost more than $100 million, though.</p>

<p>It’s possible that GPT-4’s intelligence comes from something other than just scale. One idea is reinforcement learning with human feedback, which was used to improve ChatGPT. Humans judge the quality of the model’s answers, guiding it towards better responses.</p>

<p>GPT-4’s capabilities have amazed experts and sparked debates about AI transforming the economy, spreading disinformation, and taking away jobs. Some AI experts, tech entrepreneurs like Elon Musk, and scientists even wrote an open letter asking for a six-month pause on developing anything more powerful than GPT-4.</p>

<p>Altman confirmed that <a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a> isn’t working on GPT-5 right now and won’t be for some time. So, it looks like we’re moving into a new era in AI, and it’s going to be interesting to see what comes next.</p>]]></content><author><name>sam</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, suggests that the future of AI lies in innovative research strategies rather than simply scaling up existing models.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://techwizco.com/assets/images/ai-news-ai-models.svg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://techwizco.com/assets/images/ai-news-ai-models.svg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">The Role of AI in Cybersecurity: Protecting Your Digital Assets</title><link href="https://techwizco.com/ai-in-cybersecurity/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Role of AI in Cybersecurity: Protecting Your Digital Assets" /><published>2023-04-13T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-04-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://techwizco.com/ai-in-cybersecurity</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://techwizco.com/ai-in-cybersecurity/"><![CDATA[<p>In today’s rapidly evolving digital landscape, the role of AI in cybersecurity has become crucial for safeguarding our digital assets.

In a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal, Google CEO Sundar Pichai emphasized the tech giant’s commitment to competing against the likes of Microsoft-backed OpenAI and its popular chatbot, ChatGPT.</p>

<p>Although Google’s search business is responsible for over half of the company’s revenue, Pichai dismissed the idea that chatbots pose a threat to their core business. Instead, he believes that adding AI to Google search will enable the tool to better address a broader range of queries.</p>

<p>“The opportunity space, if anything, is bigger than before,” Pichai told the WSJ.</p>

<p>Microsoft has recently released an enhanced version of its Bing search engine, now powered by ChatGPT, a product initially developed by tech research firm OpenAI. The ChatGPT launch created quite a buzz in the tech world, as the AI-powered bot demonstrated its impressive ability to answer questions and generate human-like text, including emails, summaries, essays, outlines, reports, computer code, and even creative writing pieces.</p>

<p>Thanks to the generative AI feature, Bing surpassed 100 million daily active users in March, as reported in a Microsoft blog post. Microsoft has also decided to integrate the chatbot technology into its Edge browser.</p>

<p>Pichai is not fazed by the competition from other companies. <a href="https://google.com">Google</a> launched its own AI chatbot, Bard, earlier this year for an exclusive group of “trusted testers” and fully rolled it out in March. He described Bard as a tool that “seeks to combine the breadth of the world’s knowledge with the power, intelligence, and creativity of our large language models” while also “drawing on information from the web to provide fresh, high-quality responses.”</p>

<p>This AI boom comes during a time when several tech companies, including Google, have been taking steps to reduce expenses. In January, Google laid off 12,000 workers, and it recently announced plans to scale back employee perks such as fitness classes and spending on equipment, including company-issued laptops, according to CNBC and WSJ reports.</p>

<p>With Google’s determination to revolutionize its search engine through AI, it’s clear that the company is embracing the future of technology and setting the stage for a new era of conversational interaction.

From industry breakthroughs to its impact on the environment, AI is making its presence felt in various aspects of our lives. In this article, we’ll explore some of the key takeaways from <a href="https://aiindex.stanford.edu/report/">Stanford’s AI Index 2023 report</a>, highlighting the latest trends, achievements, and concerns in the AI landscape.</p>

<h2 id="industry-leaves-academia-in-the-dust">Industry Leaves Academia in the Dust</h2>

<p>Until 2014, academia was the leading source of significant machine learning models. However, since then, industry has taken the reins, with 32 significant industry-produced models in 2022 compared to just three from academia. This shift is largely due to the increasing need for large amounts of data, compute power, and financial resources, which industries possess in abundance compared to nonprofits and academia.</p>

<h2 id="benchmark-performance-nearing-saturation">Benchmark Performance Nearing Saturation</h2>

<p>While AI continues to achieve state-of-the-art results, improvements on many benchmarks are becoming marginal. The speed at which saturation is reached is also increasing. To address this, more comprehensive benchmarking suites like BIG-bench and HELM are being introduced.</p>

<h2 id="ais-environmental-impact-a-double-edged-sword">AI’s Environmental Impact: A Double-Edged Sword</h2>

<p>AI can both help and harm the environment. Research by Luccioni et al. (2022) reveals that BLOOM’s training run emitted 25 times more carbon than a single air traveler on a one-way trip from New York to San Francisco. However, reinforcement learning models like BCOOLER show potential in optimizing energy usage.</p>

<h2 id="ai-the-worlds-best-new-scientist">AI: The World’s Best New Scientist?</h2>

Adobe’s stepping into the generative AI game with Firefly, a new family of AI models aimed at enhancing their suite of apps and services for generating media content. Adobe VP of generative AI, Alexandru Costin, says Firefly combines their “gentech” models with years of expertise in imaging, typography, and illustration, bringing a new level of value to Creative Cloud, Experience Cloud, and Document Cloud workflows.</p>

<p>Currently in beta, Firefly’s first model focuses on generating images and text effects from descriptions, thanks to the training it received from hundreds of millions of photos. Soon, it’ll be integrated across Adobe apps like Express, Photoshop, Illustrator, and Adobe Experience Manager, allowing users to generate content with just a text prompt. For now, you can visit a dedicated website to use it. Beyond basic text-to-image generation, Adobe’s first Firefly model can “transfer” different styles to existing images à la Prisma. Drawing on user-supplied descriptions, it can also apply styles or textures to lettering and fonts.</p>

<p>While Firefly shares similarities with other text-to-image AI models like OpenAI’s DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion, Adobe claims it will sidestep the ethical and logistical issues that have plagued its rivals. These issues include copyright and fair use dilemmas, as well as concerns about objectionable content, biased depictions of gender, ethnicity, and sexuality, and nonconsensual deepfakes.</p>

<p>To avoid copyright and fair use dilemmas, Adobe is training Firefly models exclusively on content from Adobe Stock, the company’s royalty-free media library, along with openly licensed or public domain content where the copyright has expired. In the future, users can even train and fine-tune Firefly models using their own content, steering outputs toward specific styles and design languages.</p>

<p>Adobe is also exploring compensation models for Stock contributors to monetize their talents and benefit from Firefly-generated revenue. It might look something like Shutterstock’s recently-launched Contributors Fund, which reimburses creators whose work is used to train AI art models. Contributors can opt out of training by attaching a “do not train” credentials tag to their work. Adobe is pushing for industry adoption of this tag to ensure models aren’t trained on out-of-bounds content.</p>

<p>Addressing concerns about <a href="https://techwizco.com/ai-art-generator/">AI-generated content</a>, Costin says Firefly models were trained using “carefully curated” and “inclusive” image datasets, with a combination of automated and human moderation and filters to detect and block toxic content. Adobe will regularly update Firefly to improve performance and mitigate harm and bias in its output, allowing users to provide feedback and suggestions.</p>

<p>The introduction of Firefly also raises questions about the impact of generative AI on creators’ ability to benefit from their skills, maintain credit and control over their work, and the viability of generated content in commercial settings. Artists have voiced their discontent with AI-generated art, fearing that it doesn’t properly credit them or that they might be associated with a model that generates objectionable content.</p>

<p>On the second point, Costin says that Adobe employs a range of techniques to detect and block toxic content, including automated and human moderation and filters. History has shown that these sorts of measures can be bypassed, but Costin suggests that it’ll be a carefully guided — if imperfect — learning process. “We’ve made a big investment in models to help prevent bias and harm in the content Firefly generates.</p>

<p>Those models analyze both the prompts and the content to ensure Firefly generates a wide variety of images that represent a balance of cultures and ethnicities, as well as ensuring Firefly does not generate harmful images,” Costin said. “We will regularly update Firefly to improve its performance and mitigate harm and bias in its output. We also provide feedback mechanisms for our users to report potentially biased outputs or provide suggestions into our testing and development processes.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.adobe.com/sensei/generative-ai/firefly.html">Adobe’s Firefly</a> is but one of several initiatives aimed at giving artists more control over their work’s role in generative model training. For instance, DeviantArt has launched a new protection using an HTML tag to prevent web crawlers from downloading images for training sets. AI startup Spawning, in partnership with platforms like ArtStation and Shutterstock, offers a tool allowing artists to remove their images from datasets used to train AI models.</p>

<p>With around 900 members in the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI), Adobe’s proposals stand a good chance of gaining traction. However, artists may still find themselves needing multiple opt-out tools to protect their artwork from being trained on.</p>

<p>Adobe customers must navigate another challenge: determining the rights to Firefly-generated artwork. U.S. federal guidance on the copyright status of AI art remains unclear. Costin acknowledges that the law is currently unsettled, but Adobe believes that using its tools to add “creative input” to a generated image should be enough for creators to obtain copyright.</p>

<p>“As always, creators will need to seek out the copyrights themselves and do what is necessary or required to obtain that ownership,” Costin says, cautiously optimistic. Despite potential setbacks on the copyright or licensing front, Adobe plans to expand Firefly, introducing models that generate illustrations, graphic designs, 3D models, and more.</p>

<p>Adobe’s Firefly is ambitious and, although late to the party, has the advantage of a massive built-in customer base. Creative Cloud boasts 600 million monthly active users, while Experience Cloud has 12,000 customers, including 87% of the Fortune 100. With Acumen Research and Consulting estimating the generative AI market to be worth over $110 billion by 2030, Adobe’s Firefly has the potential to generate significant revenue.</p>

<p>However, only time will tell if Adobe can overcome the numerous hurdles (and competitors) standing in its way, not to mention the costly compute necessary to develop and run new Firefly models. Legal and ethical roadblocks aside, Adobe must make up for lost time and mindshare in a highly competitive field.</p>

<p>Costin remains optimistic, stating that the company is up for the challenge. “Future Firefly models will leverage a variety of assets, tech, and training data from Adobe and others,” he added. “We are designing generative AI to support creators in benefiting from their skills and creativity. By building Firefly directly into our customers’ workflows, we can help creative professionals work more efficiently and spend their time on the higher-value work that they love.”</p>]]></content><author><name>john</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unleash your creativity with Adobe's new AI-powered tool, Firefly, designed to revolutionize content generation and enhance artistic workflows across the Creative Cloud ecosystem.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://techwizco.com/assets/images/ai-news-adobe-firefly.svg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://techwizco.com/assets/images/ai-news-adobe-firefly.svg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">AI Takeover: Apocalypse or Opportunity?</title><link href="https://techwizco.com/news-ai-takeover/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="AI Takeover: Apocalypse or Opportunity?" /><published>2023-03-30T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-03-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://techwizco.com/news-ai-takeover</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://techwizco.com/news-ai-takeover/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="ai-threatens-300-million-jobs---is-yours-on-the-line">AI Threatens 300 Million Jobs - Is Yours on the Line?</h2>

<p>Hey, friends! Can you believe the news that’s been buzzing around? That’s right, Goldman Sachs recently unleashed an eye-opening report suggesting that Artificial Intelligence (AI) might be coming for a staggering 300 million full-time jobs.</p>

<p>Now, if you’re anything like me, this revelation has you pondering whether it’s time to brace for the AI takeover, or maybe even start strategizing on how to ride this technological wave and potentially profit from it.</p>

<p>This just goes to show that no one is immune to the rapid advancements in AI and the potential shifts it may bring to the workforce as we know it. So, buckle up, and let’s explore what this could mean for all of us!</p>

<h2 id="creative-or-doomed-ais-impact-on-various-industries">Creative or Doomed? AI’s Impact on Various Industries</h2>

<p>Okay, let’s talk about how AI is shaking up different industries. I mean, it’s kind of mind-blowing when you think about it. Some people in the creative fields, like graphic design or writing, might be worried that they’ll be out of a job with AI doing all the heavy lifting. But on the flip side, AI could open up a whole new world of possibilities and make their work even more innovative and exciting.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, folks in industries like construction and maintenance are probably breathing a sigh of relief, since AI isn’t likely to replace them anytime soon. So, depending on where you stand, AI could be the best thing since sliced bread or your worst nightmare come to life. Wild, right?</p>

<h2 id="a-brave-new-world-ai-could-boost-global-economy-by-7">A Brave New World: AI Could Boost Global Economy by 7%</h2>

<p>Alright, folks, let’s dive a bit deeper into this report. So, AI is projected to replace around 25% of work tasks in the US and Europe, but there’s a silver lining to this cloud. Many experts argue that this AI revolution could pave the way for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-commits-up-to-35-billion-to-future-of-tech-and-science">fresh job openings</a> and kickstart a productivity surge like never before.</p>

<p>In fact, they’re estimating that the total annual value of goods and services produced around the world could skyrocket by an impressive 7%! A key player in this game is Generative AI - this cutting-edge technology can whip up content that’s just as top-notch as what us humans can create. So, while the AI invasion might be a bit unsettling, it’s also brimming with potential for growth and innovation in ways we can’t even imagine yet.</p>

<h2 id="ai-friend-or-foe-to-the-uk-job-market">AI: Friend or Foe to the UK Job Market?</h2>

<p>The UK government is all about promoting AI investment, claiming that it’ll “ultimately drive productivity across the economy.” Technology Secretary Michelle Donelan reassures us, saying, “We want to make sure that AI is complementing the way we work in the UK, not disrupting it - making our jobs better, rather than taking them away.”</p>

<p>But let’s be real, the impact of AI will differ from sector to sector. The report shows that 46% of tasks in administrative and 44% in legal professions could be automated, but only 6% in construction and 4% in maintenance. Even artists are worried about AI-generated images taking over their jobs.</p>

<h2 id="wage-wars-the-domino-effect-of-ai-on-salaries">Wage Wars: The Domino Effect of AI on Salaries</h2>

<p>Hold up, folks, let’s take a moment to consider Carl Benedikt Frey’s intriguing perspective. As the future-of-work director at Oxford University, he’s got some pretty valid insights to share. Frey suggests that while AI might not kick everyone to the curb, it could still have a significant impact on our paychecks. He explains that, instead of vanishing jobs, AI might just contribute to shrinking wages, as more people with average skills can perform tasks that used to be reserved for experts.</p>

<p>Remember when GPS technology and platforms like Uber burst onto the scene? Frey uses that as an example to illustrate his point. With GPS at their fingertips, anyone could become a driver, and the value of knowing every street in a city like London plummeted. As a result, incumbent drivers took a hit, experiencing wage cuts of around 10%. But guess what? There were still just as many drivers on the road!</p>

<p>Frey’s thought-provoking comparison makes us wonder if AI could have a similar effect on a wider range of creative tasks in the coming years. Instead of a job apocalypse, we might be facing an era of wage stagnation or decline. And that’s something we should definitely be prepared for as we navigate this brave new world of AI and automation.</p>

<h2 id="from-typewriters-to-ai-the-ever-changing-job-landscape">From Typewriters to AI: The Ever-Changing Job Landscape</h2>

<p>Some research cited in the report claims that 60% of workers are in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940. However, other research argues that technological change since the 1980s has displaced workers faster than it has created jobs. So, if generative AI follows previous tech advances, we could see a dip in employment in the near future.</p>

<h2 id="uncertainty-reigns-is-ai-really-the-game-changer-we-think-it-is">Uncertainty Reigns: Is AI Really the Game Changer We Think It Is?</h2>

<p>Torsten Bell, CEO of the Resolution Foundation think tank, reminds us that the long-term impact of AI is highly uncertain. He says, “We do not know how the technology will evolve or how firms will integrate it into how they work.” So, maybe we shouldn’t be too quick to jump to conclusions.</p>

<p>In the end, whether <a href="https://techwizco.com/how-artificial-intelligence-changing-job-market/">AI is a job apocalypse</a> or the gateway to a brighter, more productive future remains to be seen. But one thing’s for sure - AI is here to stay, and we better get used to it!</p>]]></content><author><name>john</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Discover the AI revolution that could reshape the job market - will you ride the wave of innovation or get caught in the undertow of wage decline?]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://techwizco.com/assets/images/ai-news-ai-takeover.svg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://techwizco.com/assets/images/ai-news-ai-takeover.svg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Deepfakes and AI: The Challenges of Detecting and Combating Synthetic Media</title><link href="https://techwizco.com/ai-deepfakes/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Deepfakes and AI: The Challenges of Detecting and Combating Synthetic Media" /><published>2023-03-30T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-03-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://techwizco.com/ai-deepfakes</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://techwizco.com/ai-deepfakes/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="the-emergence-of-deepfakes">The Emergence of Deepfakes</h2>

<p>Deepfakes worry many people. These realistic videos and audio clips use AI technology. They are hard to spot and cause threats to online security, trust, and privacy. Let’s explore deepfakes and the fight against them.</p>

<p>Deepfakes are fake videos that look real. AI makes them by combining and altering existing videos. This leads to realistic, but false, video footage. This technology has grown fast in recent years. It has reached a point where it’s tough to tell if a video is genuine or fake.</p>

<p>These fake videos have many uses, both good and bad. For example, they can entertain people with humorous content. They can also help in training and education. On the dark side, deepfakes can damage reputations, spread fake news, and manipulate public opinion.</p>

<p>Detecting deepfakes is hard. AI-generated videos look so real that it’s often impossible to know they’re fake. Experts are developing technology to spot and fight deepfakes. They use machine learning and other tools to analyze video and audio for signs of manipulation.</p>

<p>The fight against deepfakes is like an arms race. As AI gets better at creating fake videos, detection methods must improve as well. This is an ongoing struggle between those who make deepfakes and those who fight them.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/ai-deepfakes-02.svg" alt="Role of the AI in creating deepfakes" title="deepfakes" /></p>

<h2 id="creating-deepfakes-ais-role">Creating Deepfakes: AI’s Role</h2>

<p>AI is crucial in producing deepfakes. Deepfake apps and software employ AI to craft fake videos or audio. They’re readily available online. GitHub, for instance, hosts deepfake projects, which makes the tech widely accessible.</p>

<p>To create a deepfake, two main components are needed: a source video and a target video. The source video features the person to be impersonated, while the target video has the person to be replaced. AI algorithms, such as <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Generative+Adversarial+Networks&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholart">Generative Adversarial Networks</a> (GANs), perform the task by analyzing facial features and expressions and then swapping faces in the videos.</p>

<p>Over time, AI has significantly improved deepfakes. Initially, deepfakes were low-quality and easy to identify. However, technology has advanced, and now deepfakes are highly convincing and difficult to detect.</p>

<p>Although some deepfakes are harmless or even helpful, others can be detrimental. For instance, they can create amusing videos, like a Star Wars story with different actors, or generate corporate training videos with realistic simulations. Nevertheless, there’s a darker side to deepfakes.</p>

<p>Deepfake pornography is a concerning issue. It involves placing people’s faces, often those of female celebrities, into adult videos. This practice is damaging and illegal in numerous jurisdictions.
