According to sources close to the project, the virtual personal assistant will provide drivers with a voice-activated chatbot that will use Microsoft’s Azure cloud service to enhance their driving experience.</p>

<h2 id="ai-assistant">AI Assistant</h2>

<p>GM’s vice president of software defined vehicle and operating system, Scott Miller, has confirmed that the company is developing an AI assistant that could offer more than the simple voice commands that are currently available in today’s cars. The AI assistant will utilize transformer models, a breakthrough in artificial intelligence technology capable of learning from exponentially larger pools of data, allowing it to expand its capabilities beyond what was once thought possible.</p>

<h2 id="natural-language-technology">Natural Language Technology</h2>

<p>The AI assistant will be able to answer questions such as how to change a flat tire or what a diagnostic light on the dashboard means. It can even make an appointment at a recommended repair shop, creating a seamless driving experience that is safe and efficient. With the <a href="https://techwizco.com/ai-story-generator/">natural language technology</a> used by ChatGPT, drivers can converse with their vehicles like never before.</p>

<h2 id="car-specific-open-ai-model">Car Specific Open AI model</h2>

<p>GM’s two-year-old partnership with Microsoft on autonomous vehicles has provided them with a head start on incorporating this new technology into their vehicles. However, the version of AI assistant in GM cars will behave differently than ChatGPT or Bing Chat as it will have another, more car-specific layer on top of the OpenAI models. This layer will help ensure the AI assistant can respond to the unique needs of drivers.</p>

<p>One of the main challenges automakers have faced in creating a voice-activated interface for drivers is the lack of natural language technology capable of making them useful. This technology has now caught up with the demands of the automotive industry thanks to the breakthroughs in transformer models, which have opened up new possibilities for AI assistants.</p>

<h2 id="smartphones-competition">SmartPhones Competition</h2>

<p>Despite GM’s progress, automakers’ AI still face competition from mobile phones, which are both valuable and dangerous parts of contemporary driving in the United States, where distracted driving causes around 3,500 deaths a year. Tech giants such as Google, Apple, and Amazon have made efforts to improve the situation by integrating their phones with auto companies, but GM and other automakers are reluctant to rely solely on smartphones. They aim to create a new array of possibilities by bypassing smartphones and integrating directly with consumers’ favorite software, such as Spotify and Whole Foods.</p>

<h2 id="car-companies-transformation-into-tech-companies">Car Companies Transformation Into Tech Companies</h2>

<p>The transformation of car companies into tech companies is already well underway, as nearly every vehicle component depends in part on software. However, the challenge lies in pulling all those pieces together into one operating system. As car companies progress, some will inevitably do this better than others. They may even choose to license their technology to competitors, allowing them to take advantage of the new possibilities provided by artificial intelligence.</p>

<h2 id="voice-activated-chatbot-assistant">Voice-Activated Chatbot Assistant</h2>

<p>In conclusion, GM’s new AI assistant powered by ChatGPT is set to revolutionize the driving experience by providing drivers with a voice-activated chatbot that can assist with everything from changing a flat tire to scheduling a repair appointment. This breakthrough in artificial intelligence technology is a significant step towards a future where cars and their drivers can converse seamlessly, making driving safer, more efficient, and ultimately more enjoyable.</p>]]></content><author><name>john</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Get ready for a groundbreaking driving experience with General Motors' latest innovation: an AI assistant powered by ChatGPT.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://techwizco.com/assets/images/ai-news-car-01.svg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://techwizco.com/assets/images/ai-news-car-01.svg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">AI Story Generator: How to Write Compelling and Creative Stories</title><link href="https://techwizco.com/ai-story-generator/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="AI Story Generator: How to Write Compelling and Creative Stories" /><published>2023-03-08T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-03-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://techwizco.com/ai-story-generator</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://techwizco.com/ai-story-generator/"><![CDATA[<p>As a writer, I know firsthand how challenging it can be to come up with compelling and creative story ideas. Sometimes, no matter how hard you try, writer’s block gets in the way and the words just don’t flow. That’s why I was excited to learn about the concept of AI story generators.</p>
